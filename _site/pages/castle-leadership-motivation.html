<h2 id="joseph-nye---the-powers-to-lead">Joseph Nye - The Powers to Lead</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Good leadership matters. Good = effective and ethical. Good leaders share their luck.</li>
  <li>Leadership can be learned. It depends on nurture and on nature.</li>
  <li>Leaders help create and achieve group goals. Thus, effectiveness requires vision and interpersonal/organizational skills.</li>
  <li>Smart leaders need both soft and hard power skills: cooptive and command styles. Both transformational and transactional objectives &amp; styles are useful.</li>
  <li>Leaders depend on and are partly shaped by followers. Presence/magnetism is inherent in some personalities but “charisma” is mostly bestowed by followers.</li>
  <li>Appropriate style depends on the context. There are ‘autocratic’ and ‘democratic’ situations, normal &amp; crisis conditions, and routine and novel crises. Good diagnosis of the need for change (or not) is essential for contextual intelligence.</li>
  <li>Consultative style is more time costly but provides more information, creates buy-in and empowers followers.</li>
  <li>Managers maintain systems &amp; institutions. They help a group decide how to decide.</li>
  <li>Leadership for crisis conditions requires advanced preparation, emotional maturity, and the ability to distinguish operational, analytical and political work.</li>
  <li>The information revolution is causing a secular shift int he context of postmodern organizations - from command to cooptive style. Empowered followers empower leaders.</li>
  <li>Reality testing, constant information seeking, and adjusting to change are essential for good consequences, but emotional intelligence and practical knowledge are more important than pure IQ and judgement.</li>
  <li>Three-dimensional ethical judgement requires attention to goals, means, and consequences for those inside and outside the leadership group. Creating identities in intergroup leadership is difficult but crucial.</li>
</ul>
