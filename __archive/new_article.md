# Real-Time News Analysis for Investment Professionals with Cerebras and GPT-OSS

![Real-Time News Analysis in Action](assets/gifs/cerebras_realtime_analysis.gif)

In the fast-paced world of finance, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. Investment professionals and public relations experts need to process vast amounts of information in real-time to make informed decisions. This project demonstrates how to build a powerful news analysis pipeline that leverages the incredible speed of Cerebras's AI inference and the advanced reasoning capabilities of the GPT-OSS model to provide instant insights into market-moving news.

## The Challenge: Information Overload

The modern news cycle is relentless. Thousands of articles are published every hour, making it impossible for humans to manually track and analyze everything relevant to their industry or investment portfolio. Traditional data processing methods are often too slow to keep up, leaving professionals a step behind.

## The Solution: A High-Speed Analysis Pipeline

This project tackles the information overload problem by creating a real-time pipeline that:

1.  **Fetches News Instantly**: Using a customized Google News RSS feed, the system continuously pulls the latest articles on specific topics, industries, or companies.
2.  **Analyzes with Unprecedented Speed**: Each article is then processed by the `gpt-oss-120b` model running on Cerebras's cutting-edge hardware, which can deliver thousands of tokens per second.
3.  **Delivers Actionable Insights**: The analysis extracts key information such as sentiment, affected entities, potential risks, and opportunities, presenting it in a structured format for immediate use.

This is a critical component of a modern investment pipeline, paving the way for more sophisticated, automated, and timely financial strategies.

## Core Components and Technologies

-   **Backend**: A robust API built with **FastAPI** serves as the backbone of the application, managing data flow and communication.
-   **News Fetching**: We utilize a highly customizable **Google News RSS feed** to gather real-time news. The techniques for refining these feeds are based on the excellent guide from [NewscatcherAPI](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/blog/google-news-rss-search-parameters-the-missing-documentaiton).
-   **Language Model**: The **GPT-OSS 120B model**, an open-weight reasoning model from OpenAI, provides the analytical power. Its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks makes it ideal for financial analysis.
-   **Inference Engine**: The key to our real-time performance is **Cerebras**. As detailed on their blog, Cerebras's architecture eliminates the memory bandwidth bottlenecks that slow down traditional GPU-based inference, enabling speeds of up to 3,000 tokens per second for the GPT-OSS model. You can read more about their technology in their posts, [OpenAI GPT OSS 120B Runs Fastest on Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/openai-gpt-oss-120b-runs-fastest-on-cerebras) and [Introducing Cerebras Inference: AI at Instant Speed](https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed).

## Features

-   **Real-Time Processing**: Go from news publication to actionable insight in seconds.
-   **Scalable Architecture**: The system is designed to handle a high volume of articles and can be scaled to cover entire industries or market sectors.
-   **Rich, Structured Data**: The output is a structured JSON object, perfect for feeding into downstream applications like trading algorithms, risk management systems, or PR dashboards.

## The Future of Real-Time Intelligence

This project is more than just a proof of concept; it's a glimpse into the future of data-driven decision-making. By combining the best in open-source AI with specialized hardware, we can unlock new capabilities for professionals in finance, public relations, and beyond. The ability to understand the sentiment and impact of news as it breaks is a game-changer, and this pipeline provides the foundation for building the next generation of intelligent applications.
