## Blog Article Linguistic Realizer

According to [Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realization_(linguistics)) linguistic realization is the process by which some kind of surface representation is derived from its underlying representation; that is, the way in which some abstract object of linguistic analysis comes to be produced in actual language. Phonemes are often said to be realized by speech sounds. The different sounds that can realize a particular phoneme are called its allophones.

Realization is also a subtask of natural language generation, which involves creating an actual text in a human language (English, French, etc.) from a syntactic representation. There are a number of software packages available for realization, most of which have been developed by academic research groups in NLG. We are going to implement a deep neural net that is able to do such a linguistic realization.

### Step 1: Find the Tokens with Spacy

For this project Use PAWS / random corpus as base
- Use Spacy to identify all relevant tokens (nouns, pronouns)

Core Algorithm:

### Step 2: Create Masked Dataset with Masked Sentences / Target

Core Algorithm:

And Divide into Test, Train, Eval - Set

### Step 3: Training!
- Feed Masked Dataset to T5 Model

### Step 4: Inference with a Target Set
- Define Target BoW to accept as generated results & 
- Find probabilities for generated results for accepting / rejecting.

### Step 6: Get the Lemmas of a Word
