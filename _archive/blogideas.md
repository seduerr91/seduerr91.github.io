# Data Creation inspired by Andrew Ng & Pete Warden

- Essential because SOTA deep learning architectures are certainly good enough and available. Shortcomings are in being up2date, and ethical matters such as racism, gender inequality. 
- Pete Warden: Good enough. Focus on Data
- Andrew Ng: Story about sending emails.
- Matt:

Why data? It helps to create and learn new features. 
Laborious to automatize. You need to be / become an expert in the domain.
Are there short cuts? Zero shot learning with GPT-3 or GPT-J but not as effective. Long inference time. Hence, not really. Lots of linguistic aspects in NLP.

How does a dataset look like: 
- Two examples PAWS which allows to train for paraphrases.
- DiscoFuse which allows to fuse sentences. 
- Two central features on how to improve text. Yet, these are usually not outsourced. Thank you Google, in this case. 

How to create datasets? 3 Steps
Are they available: Kaggle, Google dataset search, 
Research: how they are being built
Built them.

Why this hastle? 
- Defensibility of your product.
- Holy grail of artificial intelligence.
- Labeling is so expensive.

Technial side next. 

likewise Pete Warden, a senior AI engineer at Google Brain communicated in his guest lecture at the Stanford University class on Machine Learning Systems Designs (Spring 2021) that the SOTA deep learning models (T5, GPT-3, Pegasus) and architectures (Transformer, Longformer) are good enough, but mind the data!
