# Never Split the Difference

## Chapter 1: The New Rules
How to Become the Smartest Person…in Any Room

"Negotiators must be active listeners in order to gain the trust of the other party."

Negotiation begins with the simple premise that humans want to be accepted and understood. Choosing to be an active listener is the simplest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By being active listeners, we demonstrate empathy and show a sincere desire to better understand what the other side would possibly experience.

## Chapter 2: Be a Mirror
How to Quickly Establish Rapport

"Good negotiators should learn how to practice empathy with the other party so they can uncover obstacles and gain trust."

A good negotiator knows that he/she needs to always be ready for surprises. A great negotiator, on the other hand, uses a specific set of skills to reveal the surprises they are certain to exist.

Great negotiators question assumptions and are thus open to all possibilities and are more intellectually agile to fluid situations.

People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. But the truth is, negotiation isn’t a battle; it is an act of discovery. The objective is to uncover as much information as is available.

To conquer the voices in your head, make your sole focus the other party and what they have to say. You need to understand what the other party actually needs and get them feeling safe enough to talk about what they really want. Negotiation begins with listening to the other party, validating their concerns and emotions, building trust and creating a safety net that allows for real conversations.

Trying to speed up the negotiation process is a mistake that many negotiators make. The problem with this is that, if you’re in too much of a hurry, it can make the other party feel like they’re not being heard, and you risk to undermine the rapport and trust that you’ve tried to build.

According to Chris Voss, there are three types of voices available to negotiators:

The late-night FM DJ voice: Basically, keep it calm and slow. Use this selectively to make a point. When done properly, the late-night FM DJ voice has the power to create an aura of authority and trust without making the other party defensive.
The playful/positive voice: This should be your default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging.
The direct/assertive voice: This should be used as rarely as possible because this has the potential to create pushback.
When people are in a positive frame of mind, they are more likely to think quickly and to collaborate and problem-solve. Positivity creates mental agility in both you as well as the other party.

Mirroring works magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said because we fear what is different and find comfort in similarity. Using mirroring encourages the other party to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your party some time, and eventually reveal their strategy.

The five-step process according to the author to own any negotiation process is:

- Use the late-night FM DJ voice;
- Start with phrases like, “I’m sorry…”;
- Mirror;
- Use silence effectively;
- and Repeat.

## Chapter 3: Don’t Feel Their Pain, Label It
How to Create Trust with Tactical Empathy

For a negotiation to be successful there has to be a specific and careful preparation for how to proceed with the other party taking into consideration all available prior information.

Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of the other party at the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so that you can increase your influence in all the moments that follow. When you closely observe a person’s face, gestures, and tone of voice, your brain begins to align with theirs in a process called *neural resonance*, and that gives you a window into what they think and feel.

Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. The first step to labeling is detecting the other party’s emotional state. The trick to spotting feelings is to pay close attention to changes people undergo when they respond to external events. And more often than not, in a negotiation scenario, these external events are your words. Once you’ve spotted an emotion you want to highlight, the next step is to label it aloud. Labels can be phrased as statements or questions. Labels almost always begin with the following phrases:

“It seems like…”
“It looks like…”
“It sounds like…”

People’s emotions have two levels. A “presenting” behavior, which is the part above the surface that one can see and hear; and the “underlying” feeling which is the motivation behind the behavior.

Great negotiators address those underlying emotions by labeling. Labeling negatives diffuse them, and labeling positives reinforce them. Labeling helps de-escalate situations because it acknowledges the other party’s feelings rather than continuing to act them out.

The golden rule is to understand that you’re dealing with a human who wants to be appreciated and understood. Labels can help reinforce positive perceptions and dynamics.

## Chapter 4: Beware “Yes”—Master “No”
How to Generate Momentum and Make It Safe to Reveal the Real Stakes

“No” can be a powerful instrument in a negotiation when it uncovers unknown points of the contention.

Pushing for a hard “Yes” doesn’t get you any closer to a victory. It only irks the other party. Contrary to popular belief, “No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it.

In a negotiation scenario, “No” provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t want.

“No” can often mean:

I am not yet ready to agree;
You make me feel uncomfortable;
I don’t understand;
I can’t afford it;
I need more information;
I’d prefer talking to someone else.

There are three kinds of “Yes”:

Counterfeit: This is one where the other party plans on saying “No” but feels that a “Yes” is an easier escape route.
Confirmation: This is a generally innocent, reflexive response to a black or white question. 
Commitment: This is the real deal, one that most often leads to a definite outcome such as the signing of a contract. But given that these three sound almost the same, you’ll have to learn to recognize which one is being used.
If you’re trying to sell something, don’t start with “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus.

As you can see, a “No” can do a lot:

It can allow the real issues to be brought forth.
It protects you from making poor decisions—and course-correcting ineffective ones.
It slows things down, giving you time to analyze decisions and agreements.
It helps you feel safe, secure, and emotionally comfortable.
It moves everyone’s efforts forward.
Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is always better than “Do you have a few minutes to talk?”

If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise “No”-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. “Have you given up on this project?” works wonders.


## Chapter 5: Trigger the Two Words that Immediately Transform Any Negotiation
How to Gain the Permission to Persuade

Summarizing and repeating the concerns of the other party in a negotiation is the best way to get them to agree to a solution.

“That’s right“—the two words that can transform any negotiation. “That’s right” is better than “yes.” Strive for it. Reaching “that’s right” in a negotiation creates breakthroughs.

Use a summary to trigger a “that’s right.” The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing.

## Chapter 6: Bend Their Reality
How to Shape What Is Fair

Starting with a very low or high offer, using offers with specific and odd numbers or other such arbitrary factors will influence parties to make a compromise or accept an offer during a negotiation.CLICK TO TWEET

“Fair”—the most powerful word in any negotiation scenario. To become a great negotiator, you must earn the reputation of being a fair one.

To get real leverage in a tough negotiation, you have to persuade the other party that they have something to lose if the deal falls through.

Here’s how you can do that:

Anchor their emotions: To bend the other party’s sense of reality, you need to start with the basics of empathy. You need to be able to audit and acknowledge their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other party’s loss aversion so that they’ll jump at the chance to avoid it.
Let the other guy go first: Going first is not necessarily the best thing when it comes to negotiating price. Let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. By letting them anchor you also might get lucky: for instance, Chris has had many negotiation experiences when the other party’s first offer was higher than the closing figure he had in mind. If he’d gone first they would have agreed and he would have left with either the winner’s curse or buyer’s remorse. However, this could have a counter-effect. You need to be prepared to physically withstand the first offer. If the other party is a tough one, they may just end up bending your perception of reality.
Establish a range:  Establish a ballpark figure with credible references to support your statement. For instance, instead of saying, “I’m worth $110,000,” say, “At top places like Acme Corp., people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.” That gets your point across without making the other party defensive.
Pivot to non-monetary terms: Make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren’t important to you but could be important to them. Or, if their offer is low you could ask for things that matter more to you than them.
When you talk numbers, use odd ones: Numbers that end in a ‘0’ tend to feel like placeholders. But any arbitrary number you throw out that sounds less rounded— like say, $78,435—feels like a figure that you came to as a result of a thoughtful calculation.
Surprise them with a gift: Make the other party feel generous by staking an extreme anchor, and then after their obvious rejection, offering them a completely unrelated surprise gift.
People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure the other party sees that there is something to lose by inaction.

## Chapter 7: Create the Illusion of Control
How to Calibrate Questions to Transform Conflict into Collaboration

Negotiators can convince the other party to solve shared problems by using questions that start with “what” or “how”.CLI

Calibrated questions have the power to educate the other party on what the problem is rather than causing conflict by telling them what the problem is.

Here are some calibrated questions that Chris uses in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:

What about this is important to you?
How can I help make this better for us?
How would you like me to proceed?
What is it that brought us into this situation?
How can we solve this problem?
What are we trying to accomplish here?
How am I supposed to do that?
Calibrated questions make the other party feel like they’re in charge, but it’s really you who is driving the conversation.

## Chapter 8: Guarantee Execution
How to Spot Liars and Ensure Follow-Through from Everyone Else

Because most communication is nonverbal, negotiators should develop the ability to interpret body language and tone of voice.

Negotiators are decision architects. As a negotiator, you have to dynamically and adaptively design every element of the negotiation to get both consent as well as execution.

Here are some tactics, tools, and methods for using subtle verbal and nonverbal forms of communication to understand and modify the mental states of the other party:

The 7-38-55 Percent Rule
The 7-38-55 Percent Rule created by Albert Mehrabian states that only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face.

Pay close attention to the other party’s tone and body language and identify if it matches with the literal meaning of the words they are trying to convey. If they don’t align, it is quite obvious that they are lying.

The Rule of Three
The Rule of Three is simply getting the other party to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation.

The first time they agree to something, that’s the first instance. For the second instance, you can label or summarize what they said so they answer, “That’s right.” And the third instance could be a calibrated “How” or “What” question about implementation, something like “What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get around?”

The Pinocchio Effect
A Harvard Business School study by professor Deepak Malhotra and his colleagues found that on an average, liars use more words than those telling the truth. They also tend to use more third-person pronouns.

The Chris Discount 
People often get tired of hearing their own name. Switch tracks and use your name instead. This creates a sense of “forced empathy” and makes the other party see you as human.

## Chapter 9: Bargain Hard
How to Get Your Price

Negotiators use different styles to bargain: they can be analytical, accommodating, or even assertive. Progressive offers can make each style more successful.CLICK TO TWEET

When you feel that you’re being dragged into a hard bargain, you can switch tracks to non-monetary issues that make your final price. For instance, if you’re trying to close a deal, you can choose an encouraging tone of voice, and ask “Let’s put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal?” Or “What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?”

When the going gets tough, you need to shake things up and get the other party out of their rigid mindset.

If you’re trying to win a deal from your competitors, pitch statements like “Why would you ever do business with me? Your existing service provider seems great!” The “why” can coax the other party into working with you.

Using the word “I” is also great at preventing confrontation. For instance, if you were to say, “I’m sorry that doesn’t work for me,” the word “I” brings the other party’s attention back on to you.

The key is to never be needy. Remember, the person across the table is never the issue, the unsolved deal is.

The Ackerman Model
The Ackerman Model is an offer-counteroffer method. The six-step process is:

Set your target price (your goal).
Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.
Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).
Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.
When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.
On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.
Before you head into a negotiation, carefully prepare your Ackerman plan. This will ideally help you get the bargain and prevent the other party from trying to milk your deal for the maximum value.


## Chapter 10: Find the Black Swan
How to Create Breakthroughs by Revealing the Unknown Unknowns

Black Swans are hidden elements that can totally change the negotiation if uncovered and used.CLICK TO TWEET

“Remember that you are a Black Swan,” says Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the book “The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.” The book focuses on the extreme impact of certain kinds of rare and unpredictable events (outliers) and humans’ tendency to find simplistic explanations for these events retrospectively. This theory has since become known as the Black Swan theory.

the_black_swan_cover

As a negotiator, you need to instill that element of fear in the other party which makes them feel like they have everything to lose if the deal falls through. According to Chris, there are three types of leverage: Positive, Negative, and Normative.

Positive leverage: This is when you as a negotiator can withhold or provide what the other party wants.
Negative leverage: This is your ability as a negotiator to make the other party suffer.
Normative leverage: This is when you analyze the other party’s stance and use it to advance your position.
Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Discovering Black Swans that give you normative leverage can be as easy as questioning the other party’s beliefs and actively listening. You want to absorb what they speak and mirror it back to them.

Let your known knowns guide you, but don’t let them blind you from what you don’t know. Every case is new, so be open, flexible, and adaptable.

Move the discussion away from the deal, dig into worldviews. Take the discussion away from the negotiation table and into the emotions and life of the other party. That’s where Black Swans live.  People find comfort in similarity. They are more likely to concede to someone who they have common beliefs with. You need to try and find that common ground.

# Startup CEO

Elevator pitch: Matt Blumberg has written an instructional manual for being a CEO, which covers the broad topics of storytelling, team building, execution, boards of directors, and managing yourself. He shares lots of his own tips, tricks, and processes, and explains how your role changes as the company grows.

Author: Matt Blumberg is the CEO of Return Path, a global email company founded in 1999 that has grown to over 400 employees and around $100 million in revenue. Before Return Path, Blumberg ran marketing, project management, and the Internet group at MovieFone.  

## Storytelling
You don’t have to be the one who comes up with your startup idea. In any case, start by talking to customers about their problems and solutions. Then vet ideas according to criteria like customer pain, market opportunity, ability to win the market, strategic fit, and economics. The difference between startups and big corporations is that startups understand that their assumptions are wrong.

To tell your story to investors, create a 10- to 12-slide presentation including your elevator pitch, the size of the market opportunity, your competitive advantage, your current status and roadmap, and a summary of your financials. Later-stage startups will need to add in the good and bad experiences of customers and how earlier plans are progressing.

To communicate your story to the team, create a document that includes your mission (goal), vision (what the world will look like if you accomplish it), and values. You can articulate these using a top-down approach, where they are set by founders and executives; a hybrid approach, where founders create them and employees weigh in; or a bottom-up approach, where you crowdsource the task to employees.

To revise your story, show it to customers, investors, team members, and industry experts, and get their feedback. Also be on the lookout for signs that you need to change: conflicting data, poor results, or internal chaos. That change takes one of two forms: changing the company (including acquisitions and adding or removing lines of business) and changing the business (a real pivot, while still using your core skills).

To bring this story to life, you need to actually start building an organization. The CEO's role will change from figuring out product-market fit to articulating the vision to developing strategies for expansion and innovation. Along the way, you’ll have to make intentional choices about non-product elements: where to put an office, what technology to use, compensation, HR policies, and more. If your product isn’t world-changing, you might choose to support employees who want to help out different causes to add some meaning to their work.

## Team building
To hire the best possible team, find candidates that fit with your culture, are amazing specialists, complement your weaknesses, and have solid references. Include the team in the hiring process, particularly for culture fit. Hire a head of HR around 50 people and a head of sales early (particularly if you need customers to test your product or you’re not great at sales). Make sure your executive team doesn’t agree on everything, and know who your “chief paranoia officer” and “chief optimism officer” are.

To scale over time, everyone has to recognize that management is a unique skill that takes constant work. As CEO, you’ll have to supervise sales and business development or marketing, finance, legal, product, operations, and HR.

Companies all have their unique culture, but there are two values every company should have: respecting employees, especially their lives outside of work; and creating an environment of trust. You can do the latter by communicating promptly, practicing what you preach, taking responsibility for mistakes, and praising good deeds.

### Hiring. 
Hiring is particularly hard for startups because job descriptions are constantly changing and the hiring process is often rushed. To avoid the second problem, take meetings with skilled professionals who could someday work for you. Source candidates from your old jobs and your team’s old jobs. And rely on your values, your company’s reputation, and your sales skills to attract candidates. CEOs should be involved with interviews for quite a while and screen for culture fit (the relevant experts can screen for specialized knowledge).

Onboarding should be a process that starts before a new hire arrives; make sure their desk is setup and an orientation is prepared. Then, set a 90-day goal for them and come back to review them after 90 days.

### Feedback. 
Incorporate four types of employee feedback into your organization: informal 1:1s that take place regularly with an agenda driven by the employee, annual performance reviews where the employee and manager assess their performance against objectives, ad hoc hallway chats to offer quick corrections and congratulations, and 360 performance reviews where employees get rated by the whole team.

Also, solicit feedback on your performance as a CEO by welcoming it and acting on it. Then, pick the top three areas to improve in and check in quarterly with the team to see how you’re doing.

Remember to give positive feedback by honoring moments like employment anniversaries, project completions, and jobs well done.

### Compensation. 
Compensation consists of base pay, incentive pay (like bonuses), and equity. To get it right, remember that most people feel undercompensated most of the time. Start by asking about salary requirements early in the hiring process. To set salaries, make sure to performers earn enough equity to be engaged, employees at the same level have comparable salaries, and you aren’t blinded by history (e.g., low-paid interns).

### Promotions. 
For promotions, recruit from the inside when possible. The exception is management positions, because good workers aren’t necessarily good managers. In those cases, try moving employees horizontally to a new role but the same level.

### Remote work. 
Remote workers can lose the benefits of human connectivity, collaboration, and focus (due to distractions). Recommend that employees have dedicated, quiet workspaces set up. Make sure they have the right software, and pay for some of their technology expenses. Also, schedule regular meetings to keep the communication flowing.

### Firing. 
No one should be surprised to be fired. Start by telling them their job is at risk if things don’t change, setting a performance improvement plan, and increasing their supervision. If you do fire someone, only communicate the reasons to a select group because of liability issues. For layoffs – where you can’t afford employees anymore – cut earlier and deeper than you think is necessary, get rid of all poor performers, and have an all-hands meeting afterward.

## Execution 
Startup life can be crazy – you go from periods of extreme, crazy work to long, slow climbs. Throughout all that, make sure the “operating system” of your company stays the same. Employees should know the schedule of major meetings, the format for major communication, and how leadership is structured. You should have an open door policy, and no one should be getting frustrated with the technology they use at work.

An operating plan should include a theme for the year and company-wide initiatives to go around it. Make sure these are communicated to the team and assessed throughout the year. Also include financial predictions. Each department should understand their role in the overall strategy, how their operations may change, and what metrics to judge their progress by. They should also set specific goals.

## Finances. 
Startup finances are difficult because you can’t always get funding when you need it, and we don’t have financial instincts about large amounts of money (e.g., the difference between $500,000 and $750,000). To avoid sudden financial problems, identify risk areas and warning signs, and prioritize which are most important. Also, recognize that you’ll always be trading off between growth and profitability. In general, choose growth first and profitability later, although some startups try to find a balance throughout.

The three forms of financing are equity, debt, and bootstrapping. Equity includes:

VCs: They have lots of money and expertise, but they may offer bad terms or fatally handicap you by not participating in future rounds.
Angels: Made up of friends and family, they usually offer good terms but can be annoying or create an emotional burden if you lose their money.
Strategic investors (other companies): They can become a valued business partner, but that doesn’t always happen and they might not invest in future rounds.
Debt includes:

#### Convertible debt: 
Convertible debt is usually a good deal, but bad terms can give away too much equity or stain your balance sheet.
Venture debt: Venture debt must be paid back, starting with interest payments, and it also involves reporting requirements.
Personal debt.
Bootstrapping includes:

#### Customer financing: 
Early customers validate your idea by paying you in advance, but they won’t be understanding about delays and can get scared by failed crowdfunding projects.
Cash flow: Doing your startup on the side means you don’t have to give up equity or debt, but you’ll have two bosses and may burn out.
For funding negotiations, have a great lawyer and insist on only one investor counsel and one lead investor. Prioritize the terms that matter, including simple security (possibly more important than valuation) and follow-on financing terms. Having other funding options – a plan B – will allow you to negotiate on terms that VCs claim are set in stone. Remember to check out your VCs: ask for references, and expect to “pay” more for good VCs. Set the tone of your relationship during the negotiations, and make sure to say thank you afterward.

As a CEO, you should be able to create a rigorous financial model that includes a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and cash flow. It’ll help you understand your drivers of success and make better decisions.

Your budget and forecasts are always wrong: things usually take longer and more money than you expect. And it’s hard to predict when your investments will pay off, what your competitors will do, when you’ll miss revenue, and when you’ll acquire another company. As a result, you need to forecast early and often. Find good software, compare your forecasts to reality, and learn to make better, less frequent forecasts over time.

Don’t go looking for an acquisition – you’re bound to run your company more poorly and earn less money. To make the most of acquisition opportunities, have multiple bidders to increase the price. Find a good home for your baby, but recognize that you’ll soon have a new boss. And be transparent with your team, but don’t over-communicate in case things fall through (and they always can).

### Data. 
You know less and less about your company as it grows, so you’ll need to collect lots of data. Collect it externally from industry events and competitors, customers, and friends of the company. Collect it internally by meeting with non-direct reports, substituting in for employees when they’re on vacation, and creating physical proximity so casual conversations and “productive eavesdropping” happen.

### Tough times. 
During tough times, keep an eye on the future: be conservative, but don’t pare things back too far. One way to be conservative is to look for small ways to cut back on your budget. You can also use the tough times as an “excuse” to implement beneficial strategies that can be effective in the long term. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, take some time to write down and talk about problems until you feel in control.

### Meetings. 
Meetings to hold include daily standup, weekly tactical, monthly strategic, and quarterly off-site meetings. You don’t need to do them all, but vary the type, format, and location to keep people from getting bored. Good meetings have an agenda, start and end on time, and discuss next steps.

### Alignment. 
Alignment occurs when everyone has the company’s interests at heart. To create it, make sure to define your mission and set annual priorities, goals, and targets; let employees figure out their own contribution to these goals; and communicate how things are going throughout the year. Also, tying everyone’s compensation to company performance can help align incentives.

### Learning. 
To make sure you keep learning, use benchmarking to compare your metrics to competitors and partners – just remember that they don’t always have the answers. Use internal post-mortems to analyze good events as well as bad ones.

### Going global. 
Opening global offices is useful to get closer to your customers. Three options are available: acquire local resellers or competitors, acquire and pivot unrelated companies (less desirable), or start them yourself. The last is the hardest, because it’s like starting a company from scratch. To do it right, make sure to send executives there to do hiring, take it slow, learn the local business customs and culture, let employees know that things will be a little messy, use a lot of videoconferencing and collaboration tools, and beware of office cultures diverging.

### Competition. 
To outmaneuver your competition, you have to always be innovating: avoid “the way things have always been done” and spin negative chores into opportunities for innovation. Consider acquiring your “good competition,” the passionate little guys without much traction. Don’t try to keep pace with “bad competition,” companies with lots of funding but the wrong ideas.

### Failure. 
Failures are inevitable in startups because they’re part of innovation and the search for a business model. Teach employees that failure is to be embraced as a learning opportunity, and admitting failure is a sign of responsibility. Just make sure no one makes the same mistakes twice.

## Boards of directors 
Boards are required in some states and necessary when you have investors. But besides that, good boards can be extremely valuable. Board meetings give you some external accountability and deadlines to work toward. Board members should be able to challenge your assumptions, help you see the broader picture, and point out patterns they’ve seen before.

Good board members will give you their time, attention, and honest opinions: they’ll take the time to get to know other executives and have much advice to offer. Take the board member recruiting process seriously, looking for these traits and choosing a diverse set of people. They shouldn’t need compensation, except for independent directors (paid with equity).

Boards should be three to seven people (depending on your stage), with two committees: compensation and audit. It doesn’t matter if you or one of the independent directors is chairman. Make sure to solicit regular feedback on the board’s performance from members and share it with everyone.

Advisory boards, which meet as a group or just individually with you, can be useful on top of regular boards. Treat them just as seriously as boards of directors, and offer members small stock options.

Create a Board Book for board meetings, which is part-meeting agenda, part-report. A lot of the value of board meetings comes from this preparation: it requires you to step back and think about things like core drivers, success factors, strategy, and what’s on your mind.

Effective board meetings will allow you to communicate the company’s status and think through issues together in an environment of “productive conflict.” And a few little details can go a long way here: schedule meetings in advance to promote attendance, spend most of your time preparing for the future, not explaining the past; send out reading materials in advance and don’t use slides; and ban devices. Board meetings should end with an executive session (you and the board members) and a closed session (just the board members).

To improve your board member relationships, have ad hoc meetings throughout the year, a social activity around the board meeting, and a meeting before the board meeting (if necessary) to alert members to big surprises or problems.

Make sure the board does a performance review of you. This will be the basis for deciding on your compensation, which can change year-to-year. For incentive pay, suggest a plan to the board for their consideration. For equity, you should earn at least 0.25 percent per year. And it’s wise to make the board aware of all your personal spending that you counted as business expenses.

It’s incredibly helpful to serve on one or two boards yourself – ideally the board of a similar but smaller company. You can also serve on someone else’s advisory board.

## Managing yourself 
The first step to managing yourself is managing your personal operating system: your agenda (your job description and current priorities), your calendar (the schedule of meetings and appointments throughout the year), and your time (making sure you spend appropriate amounts of time on each type of task).

Hire a great executive assistant, who can free up to four hours of your day by doing things like scheduling, generating expense reports, and preparing documents. You can either hire a smart, entry-level person who will eventually want a promotion, or a professional executive assistant. Empower them to not only do things for you, but act as you.

CEO coaches are useful, even if you’ve been a CEO before. They can help you become more empathetic and influential, help coach other team members and the team as a whole, help you understand how different personalities work together, facilitate meetings and 360 reviews, and give advice on organizational structure.

Have a group of your peers – other CEOs – whom you can meet with to help solve problems and offer moral support.

To stay fresh, be on the lookout for minor tweaks you can make to refresh and reenergize your work – like talking through a relationship with a colleague or editing your list of priorities. Make sure to exercise regularly and preserve some free time by being able to say no to things.

Make time for your family, and explain your work to them in more than a superficial way. You can also bring your CEO skills home: set goals and budgets, have a “home operating system,” and have “meetings.” In dealing with kids, be decisive, a good listener, attentive, and patient, and present a united front with your spouse.

Traveling can be crucial for deals that call for that in-person handshake. Take advantage of the benefits of travel, which include working uninterrupted, socializing with colleagues, spending time alone, and being semi-unplugged. Make sure to take care of your health and take a little time to enjoy the destination.

At the end of the year, take stock of your own career. Are you having fun? Are you learning and growing? Is it financially rewarding enough? Are you happy with the impact you’re having on the world?

Being a startup CEO is lonely, thankless, hard, risky, and stressful, but it can also be the “best job in the world.”


# Traffic Secrets

## Introduction
Traffic Secrets focuses on the most critical traffic of the 21st century: social media traffic. It provides guidance on how to master one social media platform before moving on to another. Traffic Secrets also explains how to encourage the right customers to gravitate towards you. The biggest problem for entrepreneurs isn’t creating a fantastic service. The biggest problem is getting their future customers to discover them. Traffic is just people. This book will help you to find your people so that you can focus on changing the world through your products. This is the underlying message of Traffic Secrets: entrepreneurs are the people who can change the world.  

## Key Idea #1: Content and Traffic Are the Heartbeat
Russell describes your company’s traffic and content as the heartbeat. It doesn’t matter how slick your company looks. Without this heartbeat your company is dead. We can spend all our time optimizing funnels, producing the perfect script and thinking about our niche. That said, without these two key features, your company is destined to fail. 

Russell describes the content as what circulates the blood flow. In humans, the heart circulates energy and oxygen to your body. In your business, content circulates resources and people.

## Key Idea #2: What Do I Talk About
You must produce content, coupled with traffic, to help your business grow. But, there are three things to consider before creating content.

### Find Your Market
When creating content, you must consider the markets that have withstood the test of time: healthcare, relationships and wealth. Your business will fit into one of these categories. You just have to think outside of the box. For example, self-development businesses would fit into ‘relationships,’ as it is about the relationship with yourself. 

### Find Your Submarket
After fitting your business into one of the three broad market categories, you want to consider your submarket. Consider your business at a more specific level. 

### Find Your Niche
Finally, you want to find your niche within the market. Your niche is where you make your money as a business. You must be very specific. For example, you don’t have a niche if you started a channel on Internet Marketing and you are just talking broadly. A niche would be creating a channel where you cover specific topics like ‘How to Date as a YouTuber’ and ‘How to do taxes (for YouTubers). You are talking to a specific group of people. Break down your ideas into the lowest common denominator. This is the most robust approach to take.

## Key Idea #3: Customer Avatar
A significant portion of this book covers how to get into the mind of your customer avatar. You want to know who you’re talking to and how they found your content. Doing this will allow you to personalize content to specific groups of people.

Personalizing is extremely important. Russell makes the point that if you’re for everyone, then you’re really for no one. You won’t drive any meaningful traffic if you are not identifying a niche and targeting your business’ content to that niche.

One way to develop content for specific groups is based on language. You want to use the language of people who engage with you. So, whenever you get emails, comments, tweets or DMs from people saying “I’m trying to find my calling, I don’t want to sell out,” write those down. That’s powerful. When you use their language, you will connect with them. Always think when you are producing content: “Would the customer avatar like this?”

## Key Idea #4: The Dream 100
In this book, Russell Brunson talks about a concept called The Dream 100. It is the idea that you have to get out there to be successful. You have to observe successful people working in a similar realm and see what they are doing to become successful. If you utilize identical tactics, you will obtain similar results. Modeling is the fastest way to learn and adapt.

The fundamental point made by Dream 100 is that there are already people out there who have your customers. These people have your audience and are clearly doing things that are attracting your audience. One hundred of these people and their aspirations are your Dream 100. It doesn’t have to be 100 people/businesses, but you should find as many of these individuals as possible and model their approaches. It is like your market research for your personal development. As well as modeling your business on their strategies, you should start networking with them and building relationships. This networking might provide a gateway to their audience. You will learn considerably more by doing this. 

## Key Idea #5: Dig Your Well Before You’re Thirsty
This idea is one that is often neglected by entrepreneurs. People have a knack of asking for things before developing a relationship. In effect, entrepreneurs have a talent of trying to find water without a well. You have to lay the groundwork before reaping the rewards of forming strong collaborations. 

You should start engaging with people before trying to sell them something, seek out a collaboration, or ask for a favor. You should also start engaging with these people’s material. Like, comment and share their posts. Over time, your name’s going to start popping up, and they’ll start to recognize you. Try to build goodwill and add value first. 

## Key Idea #6: Get Traffic
The best kind of traffic is grown organically. It is possible to obtain some traffic through paid ads. That said, often the best way to produce traffic is to produce top-quality content. If you put top-quality content out, your customer avatar will eventually gravitate towards it. The most sustainable businesses build their traffic organically. They offer an excellent service and engaging content, rather than buying vast amounts of ad space. 

Taking the organic route has high sweat equity. You have to put in a lot of work. You have to be willing to accept that you cannot be successful by just buying ads. You cannot have something without work. Traffic is about quantity, but it is, more importantly, about quality. 

## Key Idea #7: Don’t Be Everywhere
This idea challenges conventional advice from entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs generally suggest having accounts on all social media platforms. Instead, Russell believes that ‘being everywhere’ is arguably the most harmful advice to a new entrepreneur who doesn’t have the money to outsource their social media. If you spread yourself too thin, you will burn yourself out. You will dilute the quality of work across all areas of your business. 

Russell suggests that new entrepreneurs should spend one year mastering one platform. Once you have mastered one and have a steady income stream, you can start mastering the other platforms or outsource some of the social media work. 

Go a mile deep, not a mile wide on social media. Adopting this approach will help you start seeing good returns early on in your entrepreneurial journey. That said, certain platforms are much better than others for producing traffic. So, you will want to master one of these.

### Facebook
Facebook is still extremely viable as a platform for developing traffic. There are 2.7 billion Facebook users. This statistic means there are more Facebook users in the world than Catholics. 

Building supportive communities on Facebook is one of its greatest strengths. It is easy to bring together groups of people with similar passions and goals. When you can do this you can move towards selling within this space. 

As well as developing your own groups, you can use other people’s established groups on Facebook. Use these spaces to share some of your content. If you build up enough goodwill in these groups, providing a paid service still seems organic and fair. 

You also want to make sure that your profile is optimized. If you are trying to form engaged groups and post in other people’s groups, you want your profile to be clear and informative. If somebody adds or follows you, they will see your content. This is your opportunity to leave a lasting impact on this potential customer. 

Finally, you might want to consider using messenger bots to engage with a large number of people. Although highly intelligent and personalizable, messenger bots have become less powerful. That said, with the advancement of technology, it is definitely something to look out for. 

### Youtube
There are three tips for developing traffic through YouTube:

1) Your thumbnail needs to be as simple as possible. Some people try and create intricate thumbnails with text and fantastic detail. But, most people watch YouTube on their phones. So, keep it as simple as possible: a big face and some bright colors

2) Make your videos between ten and twelve minutes long. When you create longer videos, you generally get longer watch time from your viewers. YouTube’s goal is to keep people watching for as long as possible. Views are less critical than view time if you also want to make money through YouTube revenue. 

3) You should outline your video, but you should not script it. It is good to have prompts to jog your memory, but using a script can lead to bad acting. You don’t need to say everything perfectly. In fact, it makes you more relatable if you don’t. 

### Instagram
When Instagram launched in 2010, it was one of the fastest-growing social media sites. It has since passed over a billion active users. 

Russell’s friend, Jenna Kutcher, provides her own tip in this book. It is called the JK5 method. Firstly, you choose five topics that represent your brand and your customer avatar. If you had to sum them up in five ways, what would they be? This is so important, as the accounts that do best on Instagram are those that are personal. People don’t follow the music band on Instagram; they follow the band members. They want to see personal and relatable content. 

So, make sure that you identify your five areas and stick to those areas. Make your posts as relatable as possible. Don’t just reuse content from other social media platforms. Instagram users are using Instagram differently than Facebook, and you need to adapt to that. 

## Final Summary

Find and mimic your dream 100 (the people who have 100 of your target audience).
Never ask for things before developing a relationship.
Build your traffic organically rather than quickly.
Choose a specific social media platform and become a specialist at driving traffic. Once you have mastered one you can move onto the next platform.
