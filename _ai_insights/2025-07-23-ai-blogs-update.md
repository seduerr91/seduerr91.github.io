| [How Meta keeps its AI hardware reliable](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/07/22/data-infrastructure/how-meta-keeps-its-ai-hardware-reliable/) | Meta AI | The blog post discusses Meta's approach to detecting and mitigating hardware faults, particularly silent data corruptions (SDCs), in their AI and non-AI infrastructure. They share methodologies for detecting SDCs, such as static, transient, and silent errors, and discuss the impact of SDCs on large-scale AI applications like training and inference. Meta has developed novel detection mechanisms like Fleetscanner, Ripple, and Hardware Sentinel to protect against SDCs. The post highlights the challenges posed by SDCs in AI workloads and the potential impact on training and inference processes. Detecting and addressing SDCs is crucial for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of AI clusters. |
