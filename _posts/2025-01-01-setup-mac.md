Setting up a new Mac is always an exciting experience, especially for developers. It's like a fresh start, and with the right setup, you can transform your new device into a powerful workstation for coding, testing, and building cool projects. In this guide, I’ll walk you through the exact tools and configuration I use when I set up a new Mac, focusing on Python development and general productivity. Let’s get started!

---

## Step 1: Install Homebrew, Your Package Manager

The first step in setting up a new Mac is to install **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**, a package manager that makes it easy to install and manage software and tools on macOS. Run the following command in your Terminal to download and install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, update its formulae to ensure the latest versions of the packages are available:
```bash
brew update
```

## Step 2: Install `pyenv` and Manage Python Versions

For Python development, it’s essential to have multiple versions installed (e.g., 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, etc.), especially for testing compatibility across projects. Using `pyenv`, we can easily manage different Python versions on the same machine.

### Install `pyenv`
Run the following command to install `pyenv` via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install pyenv
```

### Configure `pyenv`
Update your shell configuration (`~/.zshrc`) to initialize `pyenv` and its required environment variables. Add the following lines:
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Install Required Build Tools
Before installing Python versions, ensure you have the required dependencies:
```bash
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
```

### Install Python Versions
Now, install the desired Python versions with `pyenv`. In this setup, we’ll install Python `3.11.6`, `3.12.2`, and the latest `3.13` version:
```bash
pyenv install 3.11.6
pyenv install 3.12.2
pyenv install 3.13.4
```

You can check all Python versions installed by running:
```bash
pyenv versions
```

Optionally, set a global Python version (e.g., the latest one):
```bash
pyenv global 3.13.4
```

If you need to switch to a specific Python version for a project, you can use:
```bash
pyenv local 3.12.2
```

Congratulations! You’re now managing multiple Python versions on your machine.

## Step 3: Global `.gitignore` and `.env` Setup

### Create a Global `.gitignore` File
To streamline your Git workflow, a global `.gitignore` file will exclude files you never want in your repositories (like macOS system files, Python bytecode, or editor-specific files). Create and configure your global `.gitignore` file:

1. Create the file:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.gitignore_global
   ```
   
2. Add common ignores (like `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, etc.). Edit the file with your favorite editor:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.gitignore_global
   ```

   Example content:
   ```gitignore
   # macOS system files
   .DS_Store
   .AppleDouble
   .LSOverride

   # Python files
   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   .venv/
   venv/

   # Editor-specific files
   .vscode/
   *.swp
   ```

3. Configure Git to use the global `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
   ```

### Create a Global `.env` File
If you frequently use environment variables (e.g., for API keys, database URLs), you can create a global `.env` file. Here’s how:

1. Create the `.env` file in your home directory:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.env
   ```

2. Add your environment variables (use placeholders as examples):
   ```bash
   nano ~/.env
   ```

   Example content:
   ```env
   # Global Environment Variables
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/mydatabase
   API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. Automatically source the `.env` file when your shell starts. Add this line to your `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   echo "source ~/.env" >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. Reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Step 4: Install Essential Apps

Here are the essential apps and tools I install to enhance productivity and development:

Install them via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install --cask spotify docker caffeine google-chrome zoom warp cursor
```

Here’s a quick breakdown of the installed tools:
- **Spotify**: Keeps you motivated with music.
- **Docker**: Run containers for testing and distributing applications.
- **Google Chrome**: A developer-friendly browser with great extensions.
- **Zoom**: Essential for meetings and remote collaboration.
- **Warp**: A modern, productivity-optimized terminal.
- **Postman** (optional): Test APIs quickly and efficiently.

## Step 5: Setup Workspace and Dependencies

### Create a Code Directory
Keep all your coding projects organized in a single directory. Run:
```bash
mkdir ~/code
cd ~/code
```

### Clone Personal Projects
If you maintain personal projects (e.g., your blog or GitHub repositories), clone them into this directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seduerr91/seduerr91.github.io.git
```

## Step 6: Install Granted for AWS Account Management

If you work with AWS, I recommend installing [Granted](https://granted.dev), which simplifies switching between multiple AWS accounts. Install it following the official [Granted Setup Guide](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/getting-started).

## Conclusion

With this setup, your new Mac is transformed into a highly productive development machine. From managing Python environments to organizing code projects, everything is tailored for maximum efficiency and ease of use. Whether you're writing Python scripts, deploying containers, or just managing your workflow, you now have the tools to handle it all.
