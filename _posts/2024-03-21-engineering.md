# Objective

I want to become/grow as an AI Engineer. Therefore, I want to reiterate and grow my engineering skills. 

My objective is two achieve this with three aspects:

- Committing engineering knowledge to my mind.
- Practicing coding challenges by passing the Neetcode 150.
- Speak and write at more conferences.

## Engineering Knowledge

Everything I want to know in engineering.

## Reading: **Beyond "Clean": Unlocking the Secrets of Software Architecture**

As a software developer, I'm constantly striving to elevate my craft. A crucial aspect of that journey is building a strong foundation in software architecture. After all, well-architected systems lay the groundwork for scalability, maintainability, and overall code elegance.

With this hunger for knowledge in mind, I embarked on a quest to find those hidden gems of architectural literature. Here's what my search unearthed:

* **Designing Robust Data Systems**

   If your work involves handling large datasets, Martin Kleppmann's "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" should be at the top of your reading list. It dives deep into the fundamentals of distributed systems, consistency models, scalability techniques, and the complexities of managing data at scale.

* **The Microservices Advantage**

  For those intrigued by the potential of microservices, Sam Newman's "Building Microservices" offers pragmatic guidance on designing and deploying these fine-grained services. Learn about the benefits, common pitfalls, and the finer details of creating an ecosystem of microservices that interact seamlessly.

* **Proven Architectural Patterns**

  Martin Fowler's classic, "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture," is pure gold. This book presents a treasure trove of battle-tested patterns and solutions for tackling the structural challenges that large applications frequently face. Think of it as your field guide to elegant software design.

* **Mastering Domain-Driven Design**

   Eric Evans' "Domain-Driven Design" is a paradigm shift for many software professionals. It teaches you to model software systems in a manner that mirrors your problem domain, leading to cleaner code and a deeper understanding of the business logic. 

* **Practical Software Architecture**

    "Software Architecture in Practice (3rd Edition)", by Bass, Clements, and Kazman, distills the core concepts of software architecture and provides a systematic approach to architectural decision-making. This book bridges the gap between theory and real-world applications.  

* **An Engineering Approach to Architecture**

    For a thorough and modern perspective, don't miss "Fundamentals of Software Architecture" by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. It covers software architecture's foundational principles and explores its increasing importance in the software development lifecycle.

* **Implementing DDD in Action**

    Vaughn Vernon's "Implementing Domain-Driven Design" picks up where Eric Evans left off, offering practical guidance for turning DDD theory into working systems. Consider this your blueprint for building software that's tightly aligned with the business it serves.
