# Objective

I want to become/grow as an AI Engineer. Therefore, I want to reiterate and grow my engineering skills. 

My objective is two achieve this with three aspects:

- Committing engineering knowledge to my mind.
- Practicing coding challenges by passing the Neetcode 150.
- Speak and write at more conferences.

## Engineering Knowledge

Everything I want to know in engineering.
