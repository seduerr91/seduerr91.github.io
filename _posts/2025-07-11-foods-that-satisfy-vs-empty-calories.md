If you find that eggs help you feel full on fewer calories, you’re not alone—foods high in protein and fiber are especially effective at promoting satiety. Here are other foods that can help you feel satisfied without consuming a lot of calories:

## Foods That Make You Feel Full With Few Calories

### High-Protein, Low-Calorie Foods

- **Greek Yogurt (non-fat or low-fat):** Rich in protein, which helps curb hunger and keeps you full longer. Plain Greek yogurt is best for fewer calories.
- **Cottage Cheese:** High in protein, low in fat, and has a filling effect similar to eggs.
- **Fish (like salmon, tuna, whitefish):** Protein in fish is highly satiating and can help you eat less at your next meal.
- **Chicken Breast (skinless):** Lean and packed with protein, making it very filling for its calorie count.
- **Tofu:** Plant-based protein that can be used in a variety of dishes as a filling, low-calorie option.

### High-Fiber, Low-Calorie Foods

- **Vegetables (especially leafy greens):** Spinach, kale, lettuce, arugula, broccoli, and asparagus are high in fiber and water, adding bulk to your meals without many calories.
- **Legumes:** Beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas are rich in both protein and fiber, making them very filling.
- **Whole Fruits:** Apples, oranges, bananas, blueberries, and strawberries are high in fiber and water, helping you stay full longer. Whole fruit is more filling than fruit juice.
- **Popcorn (air-popped):** Very low in calories but high in volume and fiber, making it a satisfying snack.

### Other Satisfying, Low-Calorie Foods

- **Oatmeal:** Contains soluble fiber (beta-glucan) that slows digestion and increases fullness.
- **Boiled Potatoes:** Surprisingly, boiled potatoes are one of the most filling foods due to their water content and low energy density.
- **Soups (broth-based):** The liquid adds volume, helping you feel full on fewer calories. Opt for low-sodium, broth-based soups with lots of veggies.
- **Chia Seeds:** High in fiber and absorb water, expanding in your stomach to promote fullness.

### Sample Table: High Satiety, Low-Calorie Foods

| Food                | Why It’s Filling                              | Calories (approx.) per serving |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Eggs                | High in protein                               | 70 per large egg       |
| Greek Yogurt        | High protein, creamy texture                  | 100 per 3/4 cup      |
| Cottage Cheese      | High protein, low fat                         | 90 per 1/2 cup      |
| Boiled Potatoes     | High water, fiber, low energy density         | 130 per medium      |
| Oatmeal             | Soluble fiber, slow digestion                 | 150 per 1/2 cup cooked |
| Air-popped Popcorn  | High fiber, high volume                       | 30 per cup           |
| Lentils/Beans       | Protein and fiber combo                       | 120 per 1/2 cup cooked  |
| Leafy Greens        | High fiber, water content                     | 10 per cup     |
| Fish (e.g., salmon) | High protein, healthy fats                    | 175 per 3 oz        |
| Fruit (e.g., apple) | Water and fiber                               | 95 per medium |

### Tips for Staying Full on Fewer Calories

- **Combine protein and fiber:** Meals that pair both are especially filling (e.g., Greek yogurt with berries, lentil soup).
- **Choose whole foods:** Whole fruits and vegetables are more satisfying than juices or processed snacks.
- **Watch preparation methods:** Avoid adding lots of fat or sugar, which can increase calorie content.

Focusing on these foods can help you feel full and satisfied while keeping your calorie intake in check.

## Foods That Are the Opposite: Low Satiety, High Calorie

If you're looking for foods that have the *opposite* effect of eggs—meaning they provide a lot of calories but do **not** make you feel full—these are typically foods that are high in sugar, refined carbohydrates, and/or fat, but low in protein, fiber, and water. Such foods are easy to overeat and tend to leave you feeling hungry soon after eating.

### Common Examples

- **White Bread:** Made from refined flour, digests quickly and spikes blood sugar, leading to hunger soon after.
- **Cake, Cookies, and Sweets:** High in sugar and fat, low in fiber and protein. These foods are energy-dense but not filling.
- **Potato Chips and Pretzels:** Processed carbs with little fiber or protein. They’re easy to overeat and don’t satisfy hunger for long.
- **Candy and Chocolate Bars:** High in sugar, low in satiety. They provide quick energy but little lasting fullness.
- **Sugary Cereals:** Refined grains and added sugars make these foods low in satiety.
- **Fruit Juice:** Lacks fiber, so it doesn’t fill you up like whole fruit does. Sugar is absorbed rapidly, leading to hunger soon after.
- **White Rice and Pasta:** Refined grains digest quickly, giving a short-lived feeling of fullness.
- **Ice Cream:** High in sugar and fat, low in protein and fiber.
- **Butter and Oils:** Extremely high in calories, but because they add little bulk, they don’t create a sense of fullness.

### Table: Foods With Low Satiety and High Calories

| Food                | Why It’s Not Filling         | Calories (approx.) per serving |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| White Bread         | Refined carbs, low fiber    | 80 per slice            |
| Potato Chips        | Fat + refined carbs         | 150 per 1 oz        |
| Candy Bar           | High sugar, low fiber/protein| 200+ per bar        |
| Fruit Juice         | No fiber, fast sugar spike  | 110 per cup        |
| Ice Cream           | Sugar and fat, little protein| 140 per 1/2 cup            |
| Sugary Cereal       | Refined grains, added sugar | 120 per cup            |
| White Rice          | Refined carbs, low fiber    | 200 per cup         |
| Butter              | Pure fat, no bulk           | 100 per tbsp           |

### Why These Foods Aren’t Filling

- **Low in Protein and Fiber:** Both nutrients are key for feeling full.
- **High in Sugar and Refined Carbs:** Cause rapid spikes and drops in blood sugar, which can trigger hunger soon after eating.
- **Low Water Content:** Foods with less water are less bulky and less filling.
- **High Energy Density:** Lots of calories in a small volume, so you can eat a lot without feeling satisfied.

Choosing these foods regularly can make it harder to manage hunger and calorie intake, which is the opposite of the effect you get from eggs and other high-protein, high-fiber foods.
