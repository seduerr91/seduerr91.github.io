description: Persuasion Techniques from "Never Split the Difference" for Text-Based Scenarios
---

Based on Chris Voss's extensive work as an FBI hostage negotiator and his teachings in "Never Split the Difference," here are the key persuasion techniques that apply effectively to text-based communication scenarios:

## Voice and Tone Techniques (Adapted for Text)

-  **Email Softeners**: Use "I'm sorry" and "I'm afraid" liberally throughout emails before potentially negative statements to soften the tone and prevent defensive reactions

-  **Kindness as Default**: Maintain a positive, encouraging tone as your default communication style - think "easygoing, good-natured person" even in text

## Tactical Empathy in Written Form

-  **Written Labeling**: Use phrases like "It seems like...", "It sounds like...", or "It looks like..." to acknowledge and validate the other person's emotions or perspective in emails and messages

-  **Accusation Audit**: Preemptively address potential objections or concerns in writing before the other person raises them, demonstrating that you understand their position

-  **Mirroring via Text**: Repeat back 1-3 key words from their previous message as a question to encourage them to elaborate and feel heard

## Strategic Email Structure

-  **Warning of Bad News**: Start difficult emails with "I've got something you're not going to want to hear" to prepare the reader and reduce defensiveness

-  **Finish Positively**: End emails with genuine positive intent, such as "The reason I'm sending this is because we want to work things out positively"

-  **Short and Direct**: Keep negotiation emails brief and focused on one main point to avoid confusion and maintain impact

## "No"-Oriented Questions for Text

-  **The Power of "Have you given up?"**: Use this one-sentence email technique to re-engage unresponsive contacts while triggering their natural aversion to loss

-  **Other "No"-Oriented Patterns**: "Is it ridiculous to think...?", "Would it be horrible if...?", "Is it a bad idea to...?" - these make people feel safe and in control

## The "Chris Bonus" - Using Your Name for Forced Empathy

-  **Personal Name Strategy**: Introduce yourself by name in a friendly way and ask for the "[Your Name] discount" or "[Your Name] price" to humanize yourself and create forced empathy

-  **Humanization Effect**: Using your own name makes the other person see you as a real person rather than just another business contact, increasing their willingness to help

## Calibrated Questions in Writing

-  **"How" and "What" Questions**: Frame requests using "How am I supposed to do that?" or "What would you need to make this work?" to create forced empathy and collaborative problem-solving

-  **Avoid "Why" Questions**: These can sound accusatory and put people on the defensive, especially in text format

## Email-Specific Persuasion Tactics

-  **Read Emails Aloud**: Before sending, read your email out loud in the worst possible voice to catch potential tone problems

-  **Tone Awareness**: Remember that emails will be read in the recipient's current mood, which you cannot control, so err on the side of extra politeness

-  **Summary and Confirmation**: Use emails to summarize verbal conversations and confirm agreements rather than conducting complex negotiations entirely via text

## Advanced Text-Based Techniques

-  **Paraphrasing and Summarizing**: Reflect back what you understand from their position in your own words to demonstrate understanding and trigger "That's right" responses

-  **Strategic Pauses**: In text exchanges, allow time between messages rather than rapid-fire responses to let your points sink in

-  **Loss Aversion**: Frame your communications to highlight what the other person might lose by not responding or engaging, rather than what they might gain

These techniques transform potentially confrontational text-based communications into collaborative problem-solving exercises while maintaining the psychological principles that make Chris Voss's methods so effective in high-stakes negotiations.
