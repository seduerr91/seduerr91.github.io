## India

### Delhi (21 Jan Night to 22 Jan Evening, 19 Hours)

#### 1. India Gate (Early Morning – 5:30 AM to 6:15 AM)
- **Why First?** It's a public monument and open 24/7. Early morning at India Gate is peaceful with barely any crowds or traffic, and it offers a stunning view during sunrise.  
- **Visit Mode:** You’ll walk around it and view it from all sides, as there’s no need to "enter" it.  
- **Travel from Airport:** ~30 mins by Uber (13 km).  
- **Estimated Time Here:** 30-45 minutes to take photos and stroll.  

---

#### **2. Red Fort (Outside View Only, 6:45 AM to 7:15 AM)**  
- **Why Second?** The fort opens officially at **9:30 AM**, but its massive walls and Lahori Gate are beautiful, even from the outside. Viewing it early will save time and allow you to spend more time on other attractions.  
- **Travel**: ~15-20 mins (6 km) from India Gate.  
- **Visit Mode:** Admire and take photographs from the outside, especially around **Chandni Chowk-facing Lahori Gate**.  

---

#### **3. Lotus Temple (8:00 AM to 8:45 AM)**  
- **Why Now?** It opens at **8:00 AM**, and visiting as soon as it opens means you’ll avoid the rush, as it can get crowded later in the day. The lines tend to grow quickly after 9:00 AM.  
- **Travel:** ~40 mins (15 km) from Red Fort.  
- **Visit Mode:** Enter and explore the interior spaces and gardens, soaking in the tranquility.  

---

#### **4. Humayun’s Tomb (9:30 AM to 11:00 AM)**  
- **Why Now?** The tomb opens at **sunrise**, but realistically speaking, visiting around 9:30 AM is ideal since you'll have spent time at the earlier sites.  
You’ll get the most daylight for exceptional photos here. As it's a larger property, it also takes a bit more time to explore and appreciate its grandeur.  
- **Travel:** ~25 mins (10 km) from Lotus Temple.  
- **Visit Mode:** Explore the courtyard, tomb, and Mughal gardens. Hiring a guide can also add great insights.

- If you’re not too tired, visit the city’s vibrant **Alun-Alun Selatan (South Square)** for a relaxed evening.  
  - You can try unique local street foods (like sweet gudeg or bakpia snacks) or take a whimsical ride on neon-light pedal cars (a local favorite!).  

#### **Day 2: Prambanan Temple & Cultural Immersion (30 Jan)**  

Your second day will focus on the **Prambanan Temple complex** (another UNESCO site) and some of Yogyakarta’s rich cultural experiences.

##### **Morning: Prambanan Temple Complex**  

1. **Prambanan Temple (World Heritage Site)**  
   - **Travel Time**: ~45 minutes from central Yogyakarta (~16 km east).  
   - **Explore Duration**: 2-3 hours.  
   - *Details*: Prambanan is the largest Hindu temple complex in Indonesia. Marvel at the main temples of the **Trimurti** (dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma) and intricate stone carvings depicting Ramayana stories. The site also has smaller temples worth exploring.  
   - **Tips**:  
     - Arrive early (~8:00 AM) to avoid crowds and the strong midday heat.  
     - Wear good walking shoes, as the site has uneven pathways.  


##### **Midday Option: Lunch or Temple Extension**  
- **Lunch Recommendations**: Stop for lunch near Prambanan at **Abhayagiri Restaurant** (~15 minutes from Prambanan), which offers Indonesian fusion cuisine with incredible views of surrounding green hills.  

2. **Optional Nearby Temples** *(If Time Permits)*:  
   - **Sewu Temple**: Only 800 meters from Prambanan, this **Buddhist temple** offers a contrast to the Hindu Prambanan. It’s quieter and less crowded but equally captivating.  
   - **Ratu Boko Palace** *(Optional)*: A half-ruined temple-palatine compound near Prambanan, offering stunning sunset views if visited late afternoon.

##### **Afternoon Stroll: Malioboro Street (Yogyakarta's Famous Market)**  
3. **Malioboro Street (Batik, Handicrafts, & Souvenirs)**  
   - No trip to Yogyakarta is complete without a visit to **Malioboro Street**, the city’s bustling shopping hub known for **batik fabrics**, souvenirs, local handicrafts, and authentic street food.  
   - **Browse & Buy**: Look for traditional batik shawls, wooden carvings, or silver jewelry. Bargaining is common, but always with a smile!  
   - **Visit Duration**: ~1.5-2 hours.  

4. **Taman Sari Water Palace (Optional for Art & History Enthusiasts)**  
   - Located close to Malioboro, this **18th-century royal bathing complex** was used by the sultans of Yogyakarta. It features intricate architecture, underground tunnels, and peaceful courtyards. A quick visit is worth it.  
   - **Visit Duration**: ~1 hour.  

##### **Wrap-Up Evening**  
- End the day with a traditional **Ramayana Ballet Performance** at either **Prambanan’s open-air stage** (if you stay near Prambanan) or **Purawisata** back in Yogyakarta.  
  - The performance includes traditional Gamelan music and a dramatic depiction of the Ramayana epic.  
  - Check schedules and book tickets ahead, as these shows are popular.

---

#### **Day 3: Early Morning & Departure (31 Jan)**  

With a flight departing at **9:45 AM**, there's little time to explore. Use your morning to relax or briefly revisit **Malioboro Street** for any last-minute souvenirs. Ensure you leave for the airport by **7:30 AM**, as it's about a **1-1.5 hour drive** depending on morning traffic.

#### **Travel Insights & Notes for Yogyakarta**

1. **Traffic Considerations**: While Yogyakarta isn’t as congested as Bali or Jakarta, roads leading to Borobudur and Prambanan can still get crowded. To beat the rush, leave early for each attraction and avoid traveling during midday.  
2. **Hiring a Driver**: Renting a private car with a driver (via an app like **Grab**, through your hotel, or using local tour operators) is highly recommended for efficient travel between sites.  
3. **Cultural Dress Code**: For temple visits, wear modest clothing (e.g., clothes covering knees and shoulders). Sarongs are sometimes provided for entry at no extra cost.  
4. **Photography Tips**: Both Borobudur and Prambanan offer stunning sunrise/sunset views. If you're particularly keen on photography, plan visits accordingly.

## **Singapore 2 (31 Jan – 26 Hour Layover)**

For your second layover in Singapore, since you've already explored popular landmarks like **Gardens by the Bay** and **Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck** earlier (assuming you've covered them during your first stop), you can dive deeper into lesser-explored areas, enjoy a different cultural side of Singapore, or even partake in a unique activity. With **26 hours**, you have plenty of time to explore while ensuring you get rest for your long flight back to Seattle.

Here’s an **optimized plan** based on variety, cultural immersion, and proximity to the airport:

---

### **Morning: Start Your Day Early**

Leave the airport right after your arrival (~1:00 PM if your flight is on time), check into a transit hotel or store your luggage at Jewel Changi to travel light. Kick off your day with these activities:

---

#### Option 1: **Hawker Centre Exploration & Little India/Arab Street** (Cultural Immersion)
1. **Maxwell Food Centre or Lau Pa Sat (Lunch)**  
   - Head to a famous hawker center to enjoy authentic Singaporean street food. Since you’ve got time between flights, why not finally try **Hainanese chicken rice**, **Laksa**, or **Char Kway Teow (stir-fried noodles)**?  
   - **Lau Pa Sat** also excels in satay stalls and offers a lively downtown vibe.  

   **Travel Time**: ~30 minutes from Changi Airport to Maxwell or Lau Pa Sat by taxi/MRT.  
   **Duration**: ~1.5 hrs (lunch + wandering nearby).  

2. **Little India: Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple & Colorful Streets**

   **Travel Time**: ~10-15 mins from Maxwell.  
   **Duration**: ~1.5 hr.

#### Option 2: **Pulau Ubin or East Coast Park** (Peaceful Nature Escape)
If you’re feeling adventurous and want a completely different side of Singapore:

1. **Pulau Ubin ("The Last Kampong" Escape)**  
   - Take a short bumboat ride (from Changi Point Ferry Terminal) to **Pulau Ubin**, an island that mirrors Singapore in the '60s—far from the bustling city life. You can rent a bicycle, visit the **Chek Jawa Wetlands**, or enjoy a peaceful hike through dense tropical forests. It's ideal for **nature lovers** or those who want to escape the urban vibe.  

   **Travel Time**: ~20 minutes from Jewel/Changi to Changi Point.  
   **Duration**: ~3-5 hours (including boat rides and exploration).  

2. **East Coast Park** *(Alternative to Pulau Ubin)*  
   - A relaxing outdoor area close to Changi. Stroll along the **beachfront park**, rent a bike or rollerblades, or sip iced kopi at a seaside café like **PS.Café East Coast Park**.  
   - It’s a simpler, more laid-back option if you’re short on time.

### **Afternoon/Evening Activities (~4 PM onwards): Bustling Chinatown or Classic Iconic Vibes**

   **Travel Time**: ~15-20 minutes from Little India.  
   **Duration**: ~1.5-2 hrs.  

2. **Singapore’s Famous Nighttime Experiences**:
