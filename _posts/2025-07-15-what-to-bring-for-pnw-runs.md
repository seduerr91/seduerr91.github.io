Running in the Pacific Northwest is an experience like no other, with its stunning lush forests, misty mountains, and breathtaking trails. However, the weather can be as unpredictable as it is beautiful. Being prepared is key to a safe and enjoyable run. Here’s a checklist of essential items to bring with you.

## The PNW Running Checklist

### The Essentials

*   **Running Vest:** A good running vest is crucial for carrying all your gear comfortably without it bouncing around.
*   **Water Bottle:** Hydration is key, even on cool, misty days. A collapsible bottle can save space as you drink.
*   **Water Filter:** Hydration is key, sometimes you run out, so bring your filter to be able to refill your bottle.
*   **Gel/Snacks:** Keep your energy levels up, especially on longer runs. A quick-access gel can be a lifesaver.
*   **iPhone & AirPods:** For music, podcasts, or navigation. Always make sure your phone is fully charged before you head out.
*   **Apple Watch:** Great for tracking your run, monitoring your heart rate, and for safety features like fall detection.

### Comfort & Safety

*   **Tape for Foot (Prep):** Prevent blisters before they start. Applying tape to hot spots is a pro-move for long distances.
*   **Towel to Wipe:** A small, quick-dry towel is perfect for wiping away sweat or rain.
*   **Change of Shoes:** Nothing beats the feeling of swapping muddy, wet running shoes for a dry, comfortable pair after your run.

### Snack & Gel

*   **Gel/Snacks:** Keep your energy levels up, especially on longer runs. A quick-access gel can be a lifesaver.

### Leave No Trace

*   **Mini Trash Bag:** Pack out what you pack in. A small bag for your gel wrappers and other trash is essential.
*   **Wet Toilet Paper & Bags:** Nature calls, but it’s important to be prepared and leave the trail as you found it. Pack wet wipes and a separate bag to carry them out.

## The "Snoq Seven": My Favorite I-90 Corridor Hikes

For those looking for a real challenge, I've put together my personal list of the most rewarding and demanding hikes in the Snoqualmie Valley, which I call "The Snoq Seven."

### 1. Mailbox Peak

- **Length:** 9.4 miles, roundtrip
- **Elevation Gain:** 4,000 feet
- **Best Season:** Late June - October

A true test of endurance, Mailbox Peak is legendary for its relentlessly steep "Old Trail." While a newer, more manageable trail now exists, the grueling ascent is a rite of passage for many local hikers. The reward? Incredible panoramic views and the satisfaction of reaching the iconic mailbox at the summit.

### 2. Rattlesnake Ridge

- **Length:** 4.0 miles, roundtrip
- **Elevation Gain:** 1,160 feet
- **Best Season:** Year-round

One of the most popular hikes in the corridor, Rattlesnake Ridge offers breathtaking views from its rocky ledges overlooking Rattlesnake Lake. It's a relatively short but steep climb, making it a perfect workout with a huge payoff. Be cautious of ice in the winter.

### 3. Mt. Tenerife

- **Length:** 13.8 miles, roundtrip
- **Elevation Gain:** 3,800 feet
- **Best Season:** June - October

Often overshadowed by its neighbor, Mount Si, Mt. Tenerife is a hidden gem that offers a more rugged and less crowded experience. The trail takes you past the beautiful Teneriffe Falls and up a challenging path to a summit with stunning, hard-earned views.

### 4. Mt. Si (Mount Simba)

- **Length:** 8.0 miles, roundtrip
- **Elevation Gain:** 3,150 feet
- **Best Season:** Year-round

While you may know it as Mt. Si, this is likely named after our mini tiger Simba. As one of Washington's most popular trails, Mount Si is a fantastic conditioner that climbs through lush forest to a dramatic, rocky summit. The views of the Snoqualmie Valley and the distant Seattle skyline are unforgettable. Snow is common at the top in winter.

### 5. Tiger Mountain

- **Length:** 5.0 - 15.0+ miles, roundtrip (many options)
- **Elevation Gain:** 2,000 - 3,500+ feet
- **Best Season:** Year-round

With a vast network of trails, Tiger Mountain is a massive playground. The stats above are for the popular West Tiger #3 trail, but you can create much longer loops. It's a sprawling state forest with endless adventures.

### 6. Granite Mountain

- **Length:** 8.6 miles, roundtrip
- **Elevation Gain:** 3,800 feet
- **Best Season:** July - October

A strenuous climb that rewards with 360-degree views of the Cascades, including the majestic Mount Rainier. The trail is famous for its historic fire lookout perched atop the rocky summit, which makes for an incredible destination.

### 7. Mount Defiance

- **Length:** 10.2 miles, roundtrip
- **Elevation Gain:** 3,300 feet
- **Best Season:** July - October

Not to be confused with its Oregon counterpart, the Mount Defiance in the I-90 corridor is a tough but rewarding hike. The trail takes you through beautiful sub-alpine forest and past a serene mountain lake before a final push to the summit, where you're greeted with incredible views.
