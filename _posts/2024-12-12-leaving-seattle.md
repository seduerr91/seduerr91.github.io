When it comes to relocating, every decision stems from a mix of push and pull factors—the things that make you want to move away and the things that draw you toward a new destination. After careful thought and weighing our priorities, we made the choice to leave Seattle and pursue a fresh start. Here, we’ll share our reasons, insights, and hopes for the future.

## Why We Want to Leave Seattle  

Seattle is undeniably a city with incredible qualities: access to nature, thriving industries, and a vibrant cultural scene. Yet, despite all of its advantages, we found ourselves outgrowing it. Here’s why:  

### What We Disliked About Seattle

1. **We Hate Traffic**  
   Seattle’s notorious traffic congestion isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a lifestyle disruptor. Commuting can be frustratingly long, and navigating the city feels overly chaotic.  

2. **We Hate the Rain**  
   While some people glamorize the Pacific Northwest’s misty mornings, perpetual grey skies and endless drizzle became emotionally exhausting. Seasonal Affective Disorder is real, and we couldn’t keep enduring the monotony of damp days.  

3. **Feeling Unsafe and Dirty**  
   Increasing concerns over public safety and the visible impact of homelessness left us feeling disheartened and alienated. Over time, it became hard to ignore these growing issues.

## What We Love (and Seek Out in a New City)  

Moving away isn’t just about fleeing the negatives—it’s about moving toward qualities that resonate with your values and lifestyle. Transitioning to a place like Salt Lake City might offer us these benefits:  

- **Mountains and Outdoor Accessibility**: We wanted a city surrounded by mountains, with opportunities for hiking, skiing, and marveling at majestic peaks. Salt Lake City delivers this in abundance.
- **Friendly People**: Community matters. We were looking for a warm and welcoming social environment, which was missing in our Seattle experience.  
- **Clean Streets**: A well-maintained city fosters positivity and pride in your surroundings.

## What We Need in a New City  

Beyond simple desires, we outlined key priorities—non-negotiable qualities our new city had to provide:  

1. **Better Weather:** We craved a balance of four seasons and more sunshine throughout the year.  
2. **Affordable Housing:** Skyrocketing rents in Seattle made it impossible to feel financially comfortable, let alone own a home.  
3. **International Airport:** Easy access to global destinations was a must for work and play.  
4. **Driveable for Joy:** A city with scenic drives and easy access to scenic areas was important to nourish our adventurous spirit.  
5. **Hobbies and Activities:** We sought a city with limitless opportunities for cultural and recreational activities.  
6. **Strong Community:** Building relationships and belonging to a vibrant community was a priority.

## Pros and Cons Table  

Here’s a concise summary of what moving away from Seattle meant for us and what Salt Lake City brings to the table:  

| **Pros of Leaving Seattle**              | **Cons of Leaving Seattle**             |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Escape traffic and long commutes         | Missing access to Seattle's vibrant tech scene |
| Fewer rainy, grey days                   | Losing proximity to the Puget Sound     |
| Moving away from high housing costs      | Leaving behind Seattle's rich culture   |
| Cleaner, safer environment in new city   | Adapting to a new social environment    |
| Four seasons and improved weather        | Adjusting to Salt Lake City’s desert climate |
| Mountain accessibility and sunny days    | No equivalent of Pike Place or waterfront charm |

## US Cities That Fit What We Love and Need  

While Salt Lake City might work for us, we researched other potential cities that met our criteria. If you’re considering a relocation similar to ours, here are other U.S. cities to consider:  

1. **Denver, Colorado**: Known for its incredible proximity to outdoor recreational opportunities, buzzing local culture, and an international airport.  
2. **Boise, Idaho**: A smaller city with affordable housing, friendly people, and a growing cultural scene.  
3. **Asheville, North Carolina**: Perfect for those wanting a blend of outdoor access, booming food and art culture, and a strong community vibe.  
4. **Charlotte, North Carolina**: Combines affordability, sunny weather, and a great job market in an ever-growing metro area.  
5. **Boulder, Colorado**: Offers extensive hiking opportunities, a strong sense of community, and plenty of sunny days.  
6. **Austin, Texas**: A vibrant tech hub with sunny weather, a growing foodie culture, and plenty to do year-round.  
7. **Nashville, Tennessee**: Famous for its music scene, friendly atmosphere, and growing economy.  
8. **Phoenix, Arizona**: Known for endless sunshine, affordable living, and vibrant outdoor activities.  


## Critical Appreciation  

Relocation decisions are deeply personal and depend upon your needs, values, and lifestyle. In our case, leaving Seattle wasn’t an easy choice because the Emerald City has its own distinct appeal—a thriving economy, access to the Puget Sound, and a global reputation for innovation.  

Yet, over time, the challenges we faced began to outweigh these advantages. The persistent rain took a toll on our mental health, the cost of living became unsustainable, and the city’s infrastructure strained under the weight of rapid population growth.  

On the flip side, Salt Lake City presented solutions to our challenges. Affordable housing and proximity to majestic mountains restored our sense of balance. Cleaner streets and a tightly-knit community made us feel connected and safe. However, no move is perfect. Adapting to different cultural norms, a new social landscape, and unfamiliar weather patterns has been a process of learning and growth.  

Ultimately, this move demonstrated the importance of weighing both the negatives and positives of a city, understanding your personal priorities, and embracing the courage to take the leap. Sometimes, leaving isn’t about giving up—it’s about finding a better place to grow.  


## Moving

When moving a 2-bedroom home from Seattle to Salt Lake City, you'll need to weigh time, effort, costs, and how much you're willing to handle yourself versus outsourcing to professionals. Below, I’ve broken down the major moving options for you: **DIY methods** and **professional moving services**, so you can compare what works best for your situation.

### **DIY Moving Options**  

1. **Rent a Moving Truck (U-Haul, Penske, Budget Trucks)**  
   - **What it involves**: You pack, load, drive the truck from Seattle to Salt Lake City, and then unload everything yourself.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Usually the most affordable option if you're comfortable driving a large truck (>800 miles, roughly a 12-hour drive).  
     - Flexible scheduling.  
     - Ideal for tighter budgets.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Physical labor of loading/unloading heavy furniture and boxes.  
     - Driving a truck through mountain passes (e.g., Snoqualmie or Blue Mountains in winter can be tricky).  
     - Need to factor in gas costs and any overnight stays.  
   - **Typical Costs**: $600–$1,500 depending on truck size, mileage, season, and add-ons like insurance.  

2. **Rent a Cargo Trailer (if you have a truck or SUV)**  
   - **What it involves**: Rent a trailer (like from U-Haul), attach it to your SUV or truck, and tow it yourself.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Cheaper to rent than a full moving truck.  
     - No need to rent a large vehicle if you already own one capable of towing.  
     - Good for smaller 2-bedroom moves with limited bulky furniture.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires a tow hitch and familiarity with driving with a trailer attached.  
     - Limited trailer space, may require downsizing or leaving items behind.  
   - **Typical Costs**: $100–$300 for the trailer, but fuel economy on your vehicle will likely drop significantly.  

3. **Portable Storage Units (PODS, 1-800-PACK-RAT)**  
   - **What it involves**: You pack and load a portable storage container, and the company moves it to your new location in SLC.   
   - **Pros**:  
     - No need to drive a truck.  
     - Offers flexibility (container delivered to your door and picked up at your convenience).  
     - Storage options available if you're not moving in immediately.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - More expensive than driving a moving truck yourself.  
     - You still do the packing and loading labor.  
   - **Typical Costs**: $1,500–$3,000 depending on container size, time of year, and distance.  

4. **Load Your Car or Rent a Cargo Van**  
   - **What it involves**: Pack as much as you can into your own vehicle or rent a small cargo van for the trip.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Cheapest option if you don’t have a lot of large furniture.  
     - Lower fuel costs compared to driving a moving truck.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Limited space, so it might not work for a full 2-bedroom move.  
     - Requires downsizing and potentially selling/giving away large items.  
   - **Typical Costs**: Gas + cargo van rental (roughly $300–$900).

### **Professional Moving Services**  

1. **Full-Service Moving Company (Mayflower, North American Van Lines, Allied, etc.)**  
   - **What it involves**: Movers handle it all—packing, loading, transporting, and unloading at your new home in Salt Lake City.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Stress-free and hands-off.  
     - Movers are experienced, so items are safely packed and transported.  
     - Ideal for those who can't manage the physical labor of moving.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - The most expensive option.  
     - Less flexibility in terms of scheduling.  
   - **Typical Costs**: $2,000–$5,000 for a 2-bedroom move (~800 miles), depending on how much you're moving and seasonality.  

2. **Hybrid Moving Services (You Pack, They Drive – ex: U-Pack)**  
   - **What it involves**: You pack everything and load it into a truck or container; the professionals drive it to your new city.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Cheaper than full-service movers but still saves you the hassle of driving a truck.  
     - Flexibility to pack/load/unload at your own pace.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires you to handle packing and loading yourself.  
   - **Typical Costs**: $1,200–$2,500 depending on distance, truck/container size, and time of year.  

3. **Specialty Moving Services (AKA Movers for Furniture Only)**  
   - **What it involves**: Hire specialty movers for just your larger or heavier items (couches, beds, dining sets, etc.). You handle the rest via other methods, like a smaller truck or your car.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Reduces your workload for heavy or bulky furniture.  
     - Cuts costs compared to a full-service move.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Still requires effort to move smaller items yourself.  
     - Scheduling logistics can be tricky if you arrive before your furniture.  
   - **Typical Costs**: Depends on how many items, but expect ~$1,000–$1,800.

### **How to Decide What Works Best**

Before choosing your moving method, ask yourself these questions:  

1. **What’s your budget?**  
   - If money is tight, DIY options like renting a truck (U-Haul) or trailer might be best.  

2. **Do you need help with heavy lifting?**  
   - If physical labor is overwhelming, full-service movers or specialty moving services eliminate that burden.  

3. **Are you okay driving a large vehicle?**  
   - If not, hybrid options like U-Pack or PODS save you from driving altogether.  

4. **Do you have a lot of furniture to move?**  
   - If yes, consider portable storage units or professional movers. For minimal furniture, a cargo van or your car might work.  

5. **What’s your timeline?**  
   - Full-service movers and PODS require more advance planning, while renting a truck or trailer can be a same-day decision.

### **Final Tips for a 2-Bedroom Move from Seattle to Salt Lake City**

- **Book Ahead:** Movers, trucks, and storage units book up quickly, especially during peak seasons (summer and end-of-month).  
- **Declutter First:** Downsizing by selling or donating unnecessary items can save money regardless of your method.  
- **Timing Matters:** Moving off-season (winter) or mid-month can save you hundreds of dollars on rates.  
- **Get Multiple Quotes:** Always compare quotes from moving companies and services—it’s worth the effort to find the best deal.  
- **Be Prepared for Mountain Driving (If DIY):** If driving a truck yourself, plan for longer travel times and possible weather-related delays in passing mountain ranges.

No matter which route you take, some costs will be inevitable—but with careful planning and choosing the right option, your move from Seattle to Salt Lake City can be manageable and less stressful. Good luck with your relocation journey! 🚚
