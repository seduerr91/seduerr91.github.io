Hello Everyone,

As the new year unfolds, I am filled with anticipation for the many adventures that lie ahead in 2024. Today, I want to share with you my plans for the year and offer a glimpse into my future travels and long-term living aspirations.

## Seattle - My Home for 2024

My journey starts in the heart of the vibrant city, Seattle, where we plan to nestle down into a well-appointed downtown living complex. Sharing our home space will be our newfound furry friends, Butters and Honey - our adorable kittens. 

At our Seattle residence, a new interest will unfurl - the Lindy Hop. Armed with the resilient spirit of exploration, Joy, my partner, and I plan to attend these ecstatic dance classes weekly. I look forward to attending at least 20 classes throughout the year.

For the fitness enthusiast in me, I aim to join a pickleball club and participate in their bi-weekly training programs. I aspire to hone my skills, and hopefully, snag my first league victories.

I have also set my sights on participating in two club runs - SLU & Green Lake Runners. My aim? To clock in a half marathon below the 1h30 mark whilst maintaining a balanced weight range of approx. 160 lbs.

As for further self-development, the domain of my interest for 2024 is Quantum Computing. I plan to delve into this new field during the first quarter of the year via a comprehensive course.

## Travels: Chasing Cultural Diversity

Alongside my personal progress, 2024 will also be a year of extensive travels. With Joy as my companion in this thrilling exploration.

In February, our first destination is the tranquil Hawaii, where we plan to spend two weekends co-working and soaking up the soothing vibe of the island. Then, at the end of March, we will head to the rhythmic city of New Orleans to enjoy a long weekend with friends.

As spring unfolds, we will venture north to Canada, exploring Vancouver, Victoria, and the picturesque Banff over a week's trip in May. As the summer sun bathes the skies, we will make our way to the refreshing landscapes of Alaska for another extended weekend getaway with our friends. 

Moving ahead, September and October will find us in an extensive one-month co-work trip, exploring the rich heritage of Guatemala and El Salvador.

The summer will usher in a two-month-long co-working stay in Europe, primarily Germany and Spain. Our last notable trip planned for 2024 will be a week-long vacation in idyllic French Polynesia in Decemberâ€”a perfect retreat to unwind at the close of an eventful year.

## A Global Citizen's Long-Term Living Goals

As someone who thrives in the hustle and bustle of international places and world cities, I harbour dreams of experiencing life in New York, Singapore, and London. These cities, being gateways to diverse cultural and geographic experiences - the Caribbean from New York, Asia from Singapore, and Africa/EU from London, will offer me an enriching and global living experience.

| City  | Seattle | New York  | Singapore | Munich    | London    |
| ----- | ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Years | 2024    | 2025-2026 | 2027      | 2028-2030 | 2030-2035 |

Tentatively, I envision my life from 2025 to 2035, alternating between these global hubs - New York (2025-2026), Singapore (2027), Munich (2028-2030), and finally London (2030-2035).

Here's hoping an action-packed and travel-laden 2024 is on the horizon. Follow along and join me on this exciting journey as we leap into the new year together!

Your fellow adventurer, 

Seb
