### **Cheese: The Star of the Show**
Itâ€™s not Raclette without the cheese! Go for the traditional Raclette cheese if you can find itâ€”itâ€™s creamy, melts like a dream, and has just the right amount of nuttiness. Need a substitute? GruyÃ¨re, ComtÃ©, Emmental, or Fontina are all excellent alternatives. 

What to get:
- Raclette cheese: **1.75â€“2 lbs total (28â€“32 oz)**  
  *(7â€“8 oz per person)*

### **Meats: For Protein Lovers**
For meat enthusiasts, Raclette night offers endless possibilities. From juicy sausage slices to tender pieces of steak or chicken, these proteins pair beautifully with melted cheese. Make sure to have a mix of pre-cooked meats (like sausages) and raw ones you can grill together at the table.

What to get:
- Steak: **4â€“6 oz**  
- Chicken: **6â€“8 oz**  
- Turkey: **6â€“8 oz**  
- Sausages: **8 oz**  

(Target a total of around **2 lbs (32 oz)** of protein for 4 people.)

### **Veggies for Grilling/Dipping**
Raclette is an absolute veggie loverâ€™s dream. Think of colorful, fresh vegetables that provide a perfect balance of texture and flavor with the richness of melted cheese. Grill these on your Raclette machine or in a hot skillet right at the table, and let everyone pick their favorites.

What to get:  
- Mini or small potatoes (Yukon Gold, fingerlings): **1.5 lbs (24 oz)**  
- Mushrooms (cremini or white button): **6â€“8 oz**  
- Bell peppers (red, yellow): **2 large peppers (~8â€“10 oz total)**

- Asparagus: **6â€“8 oz**

### **Bread: The Perfect Cheese Sponge**
A good, crusty loaf is essential for soaking up all that rich, gooey cheese. A fresh baguette is traditional, but you can also experiment with sourdough, rye, or any artisan bread you love.

What to get:
- Crusty baguette or artisan bread: **~1 lb (16 oz loaf)**

### **The Raclette Night Vibe**
Once you gather all your ingredients, set up your Raclette grill or tabletop pan, and let the magic begin. Start grilling your vegetables and meats, boil some potatoes until tender, and slice that bread. Then, melt your Raclette cheese in individual trays (or in a skillet) and drizzle it all over your freshly grilled goodies. Want to make things extra festive? Pair your meal with a glass of crisp white wine or beer.

Thereâ€™s something special about ending the year surrounded by good food, great company, and cheesy smiles. So whether this is your first time doing Raclette or a treasured yearly tradition, we hope this list inspires you to create your best New Yearâ€™s yet.

Hereâ€™s to a fantastic meal and an even better 2025! ðŸ¥‚
