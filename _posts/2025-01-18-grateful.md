# From Seattle Skies to Singaporean Sojourns: Life, Love, and Leetcode

Greetings from the (occasionally) sunny streets of Seattle!

You know that feeling when life seems to be moving at warp speed, and you're just holding on to your hat—or in my case, my kittens—as the world whirls by? Well, that's me right now. So, grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your jam), and let me bring you up to speed on the latest episodes of "Seb's Spectacular Shenanigans."

## The Suitcases are Packed, and So is the Itinerary

First off, tomorrow I’ll be trading Seattle’s drizzle for Singapore’s sizzle! Yes, everything is packed—probably overpacked if you ask Joy. We're embarking on an epic adventure that includes stops in India and Indonesia. I've been practicing my "Namaste" and "Selamat Pagi," but let’s be honest, my language skills might just start and end with food-related phrases. Priorities, right?

## AI Lead at Cordial: Beep Boop Beep—That's "I'm Thrilled" in Robot

In the midst of planning this trip, I got some fantastic news: I’ve been promoted to AI Lead at Cordial! It appears they've finally acknowledged my relentless attempts to integrate AI into every single thing—including the office coffee machine (still working on that one). My colleagues and I have been cooking up some incredible features that might just make your marketing emails smarter than your smartphone.

## Running Miles and Smiling Smiles

Remember that crazy goal I set to run 1,000 miles in 2025? Well, guess who’s already clocked in 110 kilometers and is grinning like the Cheshire Cat? This guy! It turns out that pounding the pavement is a lot more enjoyable when you imagine you're being chased by a herd of Bavarian cows. Plus, it's a great way to explore the city when the sun decides to make a cameo.

## Sunlight in Seattle: Myth Confirmed!

Speaking of the sun, we had a sunny day in Seattle! I repeat: **We had a sunny day in Seattle!** In January, no less. Given that it's been rarer than a unicorn sighting this December, you can imagine my excitement. I almost forgot where I put my sunglasses—probably next to that never-used ice cream maker.

## Joy: My Partner in All Things Absurd and Amazing

Amid all these happenings, I have to give a shoutout to my incredible wife, Joy. She's the yin to my yang, the algorithm to my data set, and the only one who can put up with my puns on a daily basis. I'm beyond grateful for her, even if she does roll her eyes at my latest plan to teach our kittens how to code.

## Simba and Sasha: World Domination Pending

Ah yes, Simba and Sasha—our adorable baby kittens who are definitely plotting to take over the world. If stepping on my keyboard and sending gibberish emails counts as a takeover strategy, they're well on their way. They've also mastered the art of looking innocent while knocking over flower pots. World leaders, take note.

## Goodbye Onni, Hello Bend!

We're savoring our last few months at Onni in Seattle. Come April, we'll be trading the city's drizzle for the sunshine of Bend. I've heard that Bend has more sunny days than a Disney musical, so I'm pretty excited to bust out my collection of Hawaiian shirts. Yes, I own several. No, Joy doesn't approve.

## The Green Card Saga Continues

In bureaucratic news, my Green Card just got extended for four more years! This means I can continue to live the American dream, complete with free refills and attempting to understand the rules of football (still a work in progress).

## BTC is Buzzing, and So Are We

Bitcoin has hit an all-time high—hovering around the $105k mark! As someone who's ridden the crypto rollercoaster, it's nice to be on the upswing for a change. Let's just say our travel fund got a little booster shot, and I might splurge on that fancy road cycle I've been eyeing. Joy, if you're reading this, pretend you didn't see that.

## Team Changes: When Less is More

In professional tidbits, someone from my team is moving on. While farewells are usually bittersweet, this one leans more towards the sweet side. Let's just say synergy was not our forte. I'm optimistic about the fresh dynamics.

## Leetcode and Me: A Tale of Trials and Triumphs

Finally, I took the plunge into the world of Leetcode. For the uninitiated, it's a platform where coding problems are designed to make you question your life choices. Initially, it felt like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. But now? I'm feeling much, much better! I still have moments where I stare blankly at the screen, but at least now I occasionally get to say, "Hello, World!" and actually mean it.

Life has been a whirlwind of excitement, challenges, and more than a few cat-induced mishaps. As I sit here, possibly procrastinating on the final trip preparations, I can't help but feel incredibly grateful. From career milestones to personal adventures, and the amazing people (and pets) who make it all worthwhile, I’m reminded that life’s unpredictability is its greatest charm.

So here's to embracing the chaos, chasing the sun (literally), and maybe, just maybe, teaching kittens to code.

Until next time, stay curious and keep smiling!

Cheers,

Seb
