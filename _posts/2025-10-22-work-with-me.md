As an AI engineer with a passion for technology, running, and hiking, I've found that clear communication and a shared understanding of work styles are key to successful collaboration. This document outlines my personal user manual for working together effectively.

### 1. Preferred Communication Channels and Response Times
I prefer clear, concise communication primarily via email or chat (like Slack). I'm quick to respond during work hours. For anything urgent, a direct message or a quick call is best.

### 2. Small Talk vs. Straight to Work
I appreciate a little small talk to build rapport, but I like to get down to business quickly to maintain focus and efficiency.

### 3. Feedback Preferences
I value constructive feedback that is direct, respectful, and actionable. For detailed feedback, I prefer it to be scheduled and in writing to ensure clarity.

### 4. Trust Builders and Eroders
Trust is built on reliability, clear communication, and respect for work-life boundaries. Trust can be eroded by overpromising or providing vague updates.

### 5. Frustration Triggers
It can be frustrating when expectations are unclear, there are last-minute changes, or meetings lack a clear structure, especially when it disrupts focused work time.

### 6. Accountability Reminders
Feel free to remind me to delegate tasks when my plate is full and to take breaks during intense work sessions to stay productive.

### 7. What Energizes Me at Work
I'm energized by intellectually challenging projects, having autonomy, and opportunities to innovate with AI and machine learning technologies.

### 8. What Causes Stress
Long meetings without clear outcomes, ambiguous goals, or multitasking under tight deadlines are significant sources of stress for me.

### 9. My Top Strengths
My strengths lie in my deep technical expertise in AI, strong analytical and problem-solving skills, and a disciplined approach to work.

### 10. Areas for Growth
I'm currently working on improving my public speaking, enhancing cross-team collaboration, and honing my system design interview skills.

### 11. My Decision-Making Style
I have an analytical and data-driven decision-making style, which I balance with practical experience and input from the team.

### 12. Expectations from Colleagues
I expect colleagues to be reliable communicators, respect deadlines, and be willing to share their knowledge openly.

### 13. Meeting Style Preference
I prefer structured meetings with clear agendas and actionable next steps, and I'm a fan of keeping them as short as necessary.

### 14. How I Like to Celebrate Wins
I appreciate simple acknowledgments, like a verbal shout-out or a quick team message, to celebrate our accomplishments.

### 15. Personal Insights
Outside of work, I'm an avid runner and outdoor enthusiast. I value work-life balance and am always learningâ€”currently, I'm exploring drone flying and pilot training.

By sharing this, I hope to foster a more transparent and effective working relationship with my colleagues.
