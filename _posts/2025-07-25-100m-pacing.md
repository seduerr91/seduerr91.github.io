### **Support Crew Packing List**

A seamless 100-mile race starts with careful planning. Here are the essentials every crew should bring:

#### **General Packing**
- **Flashlights (x2):** Night aid stations or parking-lot gear searches? Covered.
- **Walkie Talkies & Extra Batteries:** Essential for communication when cell service drops.
- **Chair, Sleeping Pad, Sleeping Bag:** For the little downtime you’ll get.
- **Refillable Water Bottle:** Hydrate or die-drate, as the saying goes.
- **Wagon:** Lug gear between aid stations without breaking your back.
- **Laptop & Chargers:** Tracking race updates; catching up during lulls.
- **Toiletries:** Wet wipes, toothbrush—freshen up, even at 3am.
- **Clothes (Non-running):** Comfy layers for long, changing-temperature shifts.
- **Caffeine Pills:** Because relentless optimism sometimes requires a little pharmaceutical help.

#### **Running Gear (for your runner’s drop bag or quick swaps)**
- **Running Shoes (Plus Comfy/Replacements):** Because blisters happen.
- **Tape:** To strap anything—feet, gear, even creaking handles.
- **Energy Gels/Bars:** Emergency calories—never let the runner bonk.
- **Water Filter & Container:** For remote hydration stops.
- **Sunscreen (Travel Size):** Racing doesn’t wait for shade.
- **Hat, Gloves, Buff, Layers:** Weather at ultras = unpredictable.
- **Dry Shirts/Longsleeves:** Need we say more?
- **Mosquito Wristbands:** Your new best friends during dusk and dawn at woodsy races.
- **Wet TP:** For when nature calls, literally.

#### **Technical To-Dos**
- **Download Music Ahead:** Cell service will fail, but your playlist shouldn’t.
- **Download Run Map on Apple Watch:** Offline access means less stress for all.

### **High-Energy, No-Hassle Meal Plan**

Supporting a race is hungry work. **Batch-prep meals and snacks** to last from Saturday morning through Sunday lunch and you’ll keep the whole team running strong.

#### **Saturday Lunch**
- **Cold Roasted Chicken:** Pre-slice and portion for grab-and-go. 
- **Celery Sticks:** Crunchy, hydrating, and nourishing. 
- **English Muffins:** Carbs to keep your runner’s and crew’s energy steady. Slather with nut butter or keep plain for easy digestion.

#### **Saturday Dinner**
- **Pasta with Pesto and Sun-Dried Tomatoes:**  
  Make a big batch in advance. Toss cooked pasta with jarred pesto, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and a little cheese if desired. Stores well and tastes just as good cold.

#### **Sunday Breakfast**
- **Breakfast Burritos:**  
  No one regrets these at sunrise. Scramble eggs with turkey and cheese, wrap in tortillas, and foil-wrap them for easy transport. Heat up on a camp stove or eat cold from the cooler.

### **Snacks & Drinks to Power the Crew**

Keeping up energy and spirits is crucial for both runner and crew:

- **Water:** Hydration is non-negotiable.
- **Capri Sun:** Quick, sweet refreshments for runners refusing to eat but needing energy.
- **Trail Mix:** Carbs, fat, and a little chocolate for morale.
- **Pita Chips with Hummus:** Savory snack, protein-rich.
- **Starbucks Cold Brew:** Caffeine in an instant—no coffee maker required!

### **Don’t Forget the Small Stuff**
- **Cutlery:** Forks, knives, spoons—each can be critical!
- **Aluminum Foil:** For wrapping burritos or leftovers, or even heating food in a campfire pinch.
- **Reusable Containers:** Great for keeping everything organized and eco-friendly.
- **Napkins & Cups:** For snacks and drinks on the run.

## **Final Tips from the Field**

- **Prep as much food as you can at home.** Label everything; portion snacks in small bags or containers for quick passing at aid stations.
- **Pack clothes for all conditions.** Mountain temperature swings and damp nights can be tough if you’re underdressed.
- **Charge electronics and bring extra batteries.** Nothing is worse than a dead walkie at mile 70!
- **Go over logistics with your team ahead of time.** Download everything that needs the internet **before you leave home.**

Remember, the best ultra-crew is a *prepared* ultra-crew. Keep the runner moving and the team fueled, and you’ll help create the kind of memories that last a lifetime—pain, laughter, and post-race burritos included.

**See you at the finish line!**
