## Room-classification system for Airbnb

Below is a structured walkthrough of how one might design, build, and deploy a room-classification system for Airbnb (or a similar platform) using images and textual data. Each section corresponds to a critical step in the lifecycle of a machine learning project—an end-to-end view that demonstrates your ability to see beyond the model and into the full product pipeline.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The core objective is to classify Airbnb room images and associated textual metadata into categories (e.g., Bedroom, Living Room, Gym, etc.). Because Airbnb typically has photographers and/or hosts upload various images (including furnishings, amenities, and entire rooms), we must leverage both visual features (from the images) and textual features (captions, descriptions) to ensure robust classification.

Key considerations and questions:
• What is the definition of each room category? (e.g., “Is a studio photo treated as a bedroom or living room?”)  
• Are there potential “mixed” rooms (e.g., a living room with a bed)?  
• How will we use existing pretrained CV models (e.g., ResNet50 or Faster R-CNN for object detection)?

Goal:
• Build an end-to-end pipeline that can process these images and textual descriptions, produce a room-type label, and integrate seamlessly with Airbnb’s listing platform.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Given that this is a multiclass classification problem where imbalance may not be extreme, standard classification metrics apply:

1. Offline evaluation metrics:  
   • Accuracy: % of overall correct predictions.  
   • Precision & Recall: For each specific label (e.g., “Gym”), how often are we correct and how often do we miss true positives? The problem suggests aiming for high precision (≥ 95%).  
   • F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful if we want a balanced metric.  

2. Online evaluation metrics (post-deployment):  
   • User feedback signals: If a host or user corrects a misclassification, that is feedback.  
   • Click-through or usage signals: If the classification is used for search or filtering, do users click or refine their results afterward?  

This two-tier approach ensures we keep track of performance at the model level (offline) and user engagement/experience (online).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
At an MVP level, the system could be structured as follows:

• Ingestion Module: Accepts images and text from the host’s upload process.  
• Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:  
  – Images → ResNet50 or a similar CNN-based feature extraction pipeline.  
  – Text → Basic text processing or embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings) for captions and descriptions.  
• Classification Model: Combines extracted features from image and text into a fully connected neural network (or merges them as separate channels and then merges the embeddings near the output layer).  
• Prediction and Output: Yields one of the categories (Bedroom, Living Room, Gym, etc.).  
• Data Storage and Logging: Store predictions and logs for real-time monitoring and model efficacy.  

This MVP logic helps ensure our solution can be tested quickly, both offline (with historical data) and limited online testing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In a live product environment (like Airbnb), data comes from two primary sources:

1. Host-uploaded images and text.  
   • Photos might be unstructured, varying wildly in resolution and quality.  
   • Captions might be short or in multiple languages.  

2. Third-party annotated data.  
   • For “gold standard” training labels, we can engage external vendors for high-quality image labeling and textual annotation.  
   • Additional bounding-box annotations could help if we extend to object detection to confirm room features (e.g., bed, couch, treadmill).

Data Preparation Steps:
• Cleaning and Filtering: Remove low-resolution or invalid images, handle missing text, filter out incomplete or mislabeled data.  
• Label Consolidation: Ensure consistent labeling for each class. Some images might need to be relabeled if ambiguous.  
• Training / Validation / Test Split: Generally ~70/15/15 or 80/10/10 split, balancing room categories across splits.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Because we have rich data (images plus text), feature engineering will involve:

1. Image Features:  
   • Baseline: Use pretrained ResNet50’s final-layer output (before softmax) as a fixed 2048-dimensional feature vector, or fine-tune the model for better domain alignment.  
   • Advanced: If we want to identify room-related objects, we could incorporate predictions from a pretrained Faster R-CNN to detect furniture or amenities (e.g., bed, sofa, dining table) that hint at which room type it is.  

2. Textual Features:  
   • Caption Embeddings: Use BERT or a simpler embedding approach (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec) on listing titles, captions, or host descriptions.  
   • Metadata Features: Possibly use listing-level amenities (e.g., “Has treadmill,” “Has sofa bed”) or textual clues from the property description.  

3. Feature Fusion:  
   • Concatenate or combine image embeddings with text embeddings.  
   • Build a small feedforward network that merges them into a single representation for classification.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
To build the classification model, we can consider two training methodologies:

1. Method 1 – Fine-Tuning the Head Layers:  
   • Keep the base ResNet50 layers frozen and only train newly added fully connected layers (e.g., 512 or 1024 units) plus a final softmax.  
   • Requires less data, faster to train, often decent performance.  
   • Great as a starting MVP.  

2. Method 2 – Retraining from Scratch (or Full Fine-Tuning):  
   • Retrain all layers of the modified ResNet50 architecture, from early convolutional blocks to the final layers.  
   • Expensive in terms of compute/time, requires more data, but can yield higher accuracy.  

Offline Evaluation Steps:  
• Cross-Validation or train–validation splits for robust coverage.  
• Hyperparameter Tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size, or dropout).  
• Evaluate classification metrics: precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix.  
• Aim for ≥ 95% precision to reduce false positives in the recommended or displayed category.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In many real-world Airbnb-like pipelines, inference latency does not have to be real-time at massive scale (especially if listings are updated infrequently), so offline or batch inference can be sufficient:

• Batch Inference Process:  
  – Periodically run inference on new or updated listings.  
  – Update classification results in an internal database or content management system.  

• Serving Architecture:  
  – A queue of new images triggers batch jobs.  
  – Each batch job loads the trained model, processes images in memory or on dedicated GPU instances, writes classification results back.  

For any real-time needs (e.g., a front-end that updates classification as soon as images are uploaded), we can still deploy a microservice that processes images on the fly, but for typical listing data, batch inference is usually enough.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Once the model is ready for production, we run online checks:

• A/B Testing or Incremental Rollout:  
  – Deploy the new classification model to a small percentage of images/listers.  
  – Compare user feedback, listing impressions, or correct classification reports.  
• Monitoring Dashboard:  
  – Continuously track daily/weekly metrics—precision/recall on new data, user feedback, misclassification rates.  

If results remain strong, expand the traffic to 100%. Otherwise, refine model or fix issues based on user feedback or system logs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
As Airbnb’s inventory and volume of images grow, we need to ensure the system scales while preserving accuracy:

• Scalability Considerations:  
  – Move batch inference to a distributed compute environment (e.g., Spark or a custom GPU cluster).  
  – Cache repeated inferences if the same image is re-used across listings.  

• Monitoring:  
  – Real-time anomaly detection on classification distributions.  
  – Track drift in input data (e.g., if new style of images or room types appear).  

• Model Updates & Retraining:  
  – Periodically incorporate new labeled data to capture any domain shifts.  
  – Evaluate the gain from object-detection-based signals (e.g., presence of a treadmill) to refine classifications.  
  – Consider transferring knowledge from other internal CV models or open-source research to further improve performance.

Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By following these nine steps—formulating the room-classification problem, defining offline/online metrics, laying out the MVP pipeline, gathering/cleaning data, performing thoughtful feature engineering, building and evaluating the model, setting up prediction services, carefully rolling it out, and finally scaling/monitoring—the solution can achieve high precision, remain maintainable, and adapt to future needs. This approach will demonstrate a fully scoped end-to-end machine learning deployment, from data ingestion to real-world impact on Airbnb’s search and listing experiences.

## Instagram Feed Recommendation

Below is an end-to-end walkthrough of how one might design and deploy a “Feed Recommendation System for Non-Friend Content” on Instagram, following the same nine-step framework we used before. Each step captures key considerations for building a robust recommendation pipeline—from problem definition all the way through monitoring and iteration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal  
Recommend interesting content from users/accounts outside the viewer’s direct network, e.g., the “Explore” tab on Instagram. We identify seeds (authors/posts a user has shown high engagement with) and expand these seeds via user embeddings, co-occurrence signals, or other methods to produce diverse candidate sets.

Key Aspects  
• Address potential cold-start scenarios by recommending popular or semi-related content when the user has little interaction history.  
• Optimize for user interests, so that they discover new communities or content categories that align with their preferences.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Offline  
• Recall: For the initial candidate-generation stage, capturing a broad set of relevant content.  
• Precision / CTR: In ranking stage, how many of the recommended posts do people actually engage with (click, like, comment, save)?  
• Negative-engagement measures: Observe how often a user marks content as “not interested.”

Online  
• Engagement Rate: Likes, comments, saves, follows.  
• Follow-Through Rate: Do users end up following newly discovered authors?  
• Session Time or Return Visits: Are they spending more time in the Explore feed as a sign of interest?  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
High-Level Flow  
1. Seed Identification: Use signals from the user’s engagement history (liked and saved posts, authors followed) to establish reference items or authors.  
2. Candidate Generation:  
   • Embedding Similarity: Retrieve posts/authors with high similarity to the user’s seed embeddings.  
   • Co-occurrence Similarity: Retrieve posts frequently co-viewed or co-engaged with the user’s seeds.  
3. Ranking: Score candidates using a ranking model (Two-Tower neural net, Gradient Boosted Trees, or a hybrid) and reorder them based on predicted relevance and user engagement likelihood.  
4. Serving & Feedback Loop: Serve top-ranked content in the Explore feed. Capture feedback (likes, hides) for iterative refinement.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Data Sources  
• Engagement Logs: Likes, comments, saves, close-friend shares, etc.  
• Negative Signals: “Not interested” clicks or hides.  
• User Graph: The set of user->follows->author edges, plus second-hop data.  
• Content Metadata: Captions, hashtags, or short texts accompanying images or videos.

Data Preparation  
• Clean & Filter: Remove spammy or low-quality content, handle out-of-bounds or incomplete logs.  
• Aggregate Interaction Histories: For each user, build a summary vector of their posted content interactions from the last X days/weeks/months.  
• Split: Maintain separate training (historical data), validation, and test sets. Ensure coverage of various user segments, including new or less active users.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. User Embeddings  
   • Train embeddings using an approach analogous to word2vec on user-item interactions. Each user and each content item can be embedded in the same feature space.  
   • Alternatively, use a two-tower network that separately learns user embeddings and item embeddings, then compute dot-products to generate similarity scores.

2. Content Features  
   • Media-Taxonomy Embeddings: Classify each piece of media by topic (travel, food, sports, etc.).  
   • Image/Video Features: Use pretrained CNNs or simpler classification signals (e.g., presence of a dog, beach, or text-laden image).  
   • Author/Media Stats: Engagement rates, average likes, trending signals.  

3. Co-occurrence Signals  
   • For items that appear often in the same session or user’s feed, compute co-occurrence frequencies. This co-occurrence matrix can be used directly for item-based recommendations (like “people who engaged with X also engaged with Y”).

4. Graph-based Features  
   • One-hop and two-hop connections: For new or low-engagement users, see who they follow, and who those accounts follow.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Candidate Generation  
• Embedding-based retrieval:  
  – Build approximate nearest-neighbor indices (ANN) on top of item embeddings for fast large-scale lookups.  
• Co-occurrence-based retrieval:  
  – For each seed item, retrieve top-N co-occurring items from a frequency-based store (e.g., Redis or a big table with aggregated counts).

Ranking  
• Two-Tower Model:  
  – One tower for user features, one tower for item features. The final layer outputs a match score which can be combined with additional features.  
• Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) Layer:  
  – Combine user–item related features (e.g., embedding similarity, content category) and session context signals (e.g., time of day, device) to predict the probability of engagement or “not interested.”

Offline Evaluation  
• Precision, Recall, NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) for “top K recommended items” relative to the user’s actual engagements.  
• Check that the model’s probability estimates correlate with real user behavior (calibration).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Real-time or Near Real-time Serving  
• Latency Requirements: The Explore feed is typically shown instantly when a user navigates to it. We thus maintain:  
  – A prebuilt candidate pool (ANN or co-occurrence) for quickly retrieving new items.  
  – A fast inference service or caching layer for the ranker.  

System Architecture  
• Generate a short list of candidate items from the retrieval step.  
• Send them to the ranking model for scoring.  
• The microservice returns the final top items to the Explore feed.  
• Log user interactions (positives/negatives) for downstream training updates.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Staged Rollouts and A/B Testing  
• Deploy the new model to a small user subset to compare metrics (CTR, average engagement time, negative feedback rate) vs. a control group.  
• Expand rollout only after ensuring improvements are consistent across different user segments (power users, new users, etc.).

Cold Start Handling  
• If a user has minimal engagement data:  
  – Use fallback logic to recommend popular posts or topics typical for new accounts.  
  – Use one-hop or two-hop expansions from any small set of known favorites.  

Monitoring  
• Create dashboards to track real-time average CTR, the fraction of “not interested” clicks, follow-through rates, and the distribution of recommended topics.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scale  
• Candidate Retrieval Infrastructure: For billions of items, use streaming or batch frameworks (Spark, Flink) for co-occurrence updates and near-real-time embedding index refresh.  
• ANN Index Maintenance: Efficiently maintain large-scale approximate nearest-neighbor data structures and keep them up-to-date with new content.

Monitoring  
• Delayed Feedback Issues: Likes/saves might occur minutes or hours later. Consider nearline or daily data ingestion.  
• Drift Detection: Monitor if new content categories emerge and embeddings no longer reflect user interests accurately.

Model Updates  
• Periodically retrain embeddings and user/item towers based on the latest engagement signals.  
• Evaluate advanced approaches (e.g., multi-task learning or on-device feedback signals).  
• Incorporate new signals (e.g., time decay of older engagements, ephemeral Stories interactions if relevant).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Summary  
By systematically walking through these nine steps—defining the recommendation problem for non-connected content, selecting and monitoring relevant offline/online  smetrics, outlining the MVP architecture, preparing user–item interaction data, engineering robust features, developing and evaluating the multi-stage model pipeline, serving candidates in real-time, and finally testing, deploying, and iterating—Instagram or similar social networks can provide personalized, engaging “Explore” feeds that help users discover fresh and interesting content beyond their immediate friend circles.

## Linkedin Talent Search

Below is a structured, nine-step overview of how to design and deploy a “Talent Search and Recommendation” system for LinkedIn, focusing on optimizing for InMail acceptance. Each step mirrors our previous framework, covering everything from establishing the problem requirements to ongoing monitoring and improvements.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal  
• Help recruiters find potential candidates who are most likely to respond to an InMail request.  
• Optimize for the probability of an “InMail acceptance” (i.e., a candidate replying or otherwise engaging positively).

Key Aspects  
• The recruiter has specific context (e.g., job role, location, seniority) and text-based queries (e.g., “Machine Learning Engineer”), while each candidate has a detailed profile (title, experience, skills, etc.).  
• The system should return a ranked list of candidates with the highest likelihood of:
  – Matching the recruiter’s query,  
  – Having a strong chance of responding to an InMail.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Offline Metrics  
• Precision at 5, Precision at 25: Among the top 5 or 25 returns, how many are relevant?  
• NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Captures not only if the right candidate is returned but also whether they are placed near the top.

Online Metric  
• Overall InMail Acceptance Rate: Real-time or near real-time measure of how often a candidate accepts an InMail from a recruiter after seeing the recommended results.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Basic System Flow  
1. Recruiter enters a query (e.g., “Dentist in San Diego”).  
2. Retrieval Stack: Uses Lucene-based search, which consults an inverted index to pull candidate profiles containing relevant terms.  
3. Ranking Stack (Layer 1 & Layer 2):  
   • Layer 1 (L1): Large-scale candidate retrieval and preliminary ranking (distributed).  
   • Layer 2 (L2): Refines the shorter list of candidate profiles, applying advanced dynamic features from external caches (e.g., profile freshness, secondary signals).  
4. Final ranked list is shown to the recruiter.  
5. Recruiter sends InMails; the acceptance data is fed back to improve the system.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Data Inputs  
• Recruiter Context: Search filters, custom notes or criteria.  
• Query Context: The literal textual query, plus additional structured constraints (location, role).  
• Candidate Profiles: Work experience, skills, job-seeking status, current title, location, endorsements, etc.  
• Engagement Histories: Past InMail acceptance rates, how often recruiters with similar queries selected certain candidates.  

Data Preparation Steps  
• Cleaning & Normalization: Ensure consistent data formats (job titles, text fields, skills).  
• Tri-gram & Text Embeddings: For candidate profiles and recruiter queries, build textual representations that can capture frequent multi-word phrases (e.g., “deep learning,” or “machine learning engineer”).  
• Index Building:  
  – Inverted fields (for fast, term-based lookups).  
  – Forward fields (store metadata used to compute ranking features).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Textual Features  
   • Text Embeddings: For queries and candidate profiles, turning relevant text into vector embeddings.  
   • Fuzzy Matches: For capturing variations (e.g., “Big Data Scientist” vs. “Machine Learning Engineer”).

2. Contextual Features  
   • Recruiter Context: The recruiter’s own hiring patterns, job postings they manage, location filters, etc.  
   • Candidate Context: Seniority, last active date, job-seeking signals.

3. Pairwise Ranking Features  
   • Features capturing how a candidate compares to other candidates in the same query (since pairwise ranking has shown good results).  

4. Fuzzy Matching  
   • Approach 1: Simple fuzzy semantic match on title IDs or synonyms.  
   • Approach 2 (Preferred): Co-occurrence graph embeddings extracted from the large LinkedIn database, capturing relationships between profile terms (scales better).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Candidate Retrieval (L1)  
• Lucene-based text matching.  
• Use an aggregator to merge partial results from multiple shards.  
• Possibly incorporate semantic matching (co-occurrence embeddings) to handle queries like “Machine Learning Engineer” or “Data Scientist.”

Ranking (L2)  
• XGBoost Model:  
  – Integrates an array of features, including text similarity, recruiter–candidate interactions, profile freshness, job-seeking signals.  
  – Handles non-linear relationships effectively.  
• Pairwise Two-Tower Network (Alternative):  
  – One tower for the recruiter query, another for the candidate profile.  
  – Predict which candidate of a pair is more likely to be accepted.  

Offline Evaluation  
• Use historical data: Where a recruiter’s query led them to certain candidates, and whether those candidates accepted InMails.  
• Evaluate with Precision@5, Precision@25, and NDCG based on ground truth “acceptances” or other signals of relevance found offline.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Serving Layer  
• L1: Large-scale distributed index retrieval.  
• L2: On a smaller subset, apply more computationally expensive models and fetch dynamic features from caches (e.g., if the candidate recently updated their profile).

Latency Requirements & Architecture  
• Recruiters typically expect near-instant search results.  
• Keep minimal overhead—precompute or cache certain embeddings or partial ranking scores to speed up L2.  
• The final ranking is returned to the recruiter’s GUI with the next possible subset of candidates.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rollout Strategy  
• A/B Testing: Expose a fraction of recruiter queries to the new ranking model. Compare InMail acceptance rates vs. the old model.  
• Segment Testing: Evaluate performance for niche fields (e.g., medical professions) versus broad software roles to ensure robust performance across diverse domains.

Monitoring  
• Track real-time acceptance rates in a dashboard.  
• Watch click-through rates (how often the recruiter views a candidate’s profile) or “InMail sent” rates.  

Interpretability & Feedback  
• Provide transparency for recruiters if feasible (e.g., “Recommended because you searched for ‘machine learning engineer’ and this candidate recently updated data with these skills”).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scalability  
• Index Sharding: As LinkedIn’s member base grows, scale the inverted and forward indexes across multiple servers.  
• Near Real-time Updates: New candidate profiles or updated skills should propagate to the search index quickly to maintain freshness (especially if a candidate recently turned on “Open to Work”).

Monitoring  
• Pipeline Health: Automatic alerts if query latency spikes or acceptance rates drop.  
• Relevance Drift: Confirm that the model is not drifting away from top feature signals as user behaviors and job titles evolve.

Model Updates  
• Periodic Retraining: Retrain embeddings and XGBoost models on recent data to incorporate new patterns.  
• Fine-tune Pairwise vs. Pointwise Approaches: Continually experiment to confirm which approach yields higher acceptance rates.  
• Explore More Advanced Architectures: Multi-task learning that also optimizes candidate engagement or recruiter satisfaction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Summary  
Following these nine steps ensures an end-to-end approach to LinkedIn’s Talent Search: from defining the InMail acceptance optimization, selecting robust offline/online metrics, architecting the retrieval and ranking stacks, leveraging tri-gram extraction and text embeddings for profile-query matching, to deploying pairwise ML ranking and carefully A/B testing. Iterating on model design, handling fuzzy or semantic matches, and continuously updating the system for scale will help recruiters fill roles more efficiently and improve overall user satisfaction on LinkedIn.

## LinkedIn People You May Know

Below is a nine-step roadmap for designing and deploying a “People You May Know” (PYMK) system on LinkedIn, focusing on connection recommendations. As in previous examples, we’ll go from problem definition to implementation details and ongoing monitoring.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal  
• Recommend potential new connections that a member (u) might know or be interested in connecting with.  
• Optimize for both the probability that u invites v and v accepts (“P(u,v)”) and the value (“V(u,v,o)”) that forming this connection brings—such as future interactions, engagements, etc.

High-Level Design  
• Each candidate v is given a composite score:  
  score(u,v) = P(u,v) × Σ (over objectives o) [w(u,o) × V(u,v,o)]  
  where:  
   – P(u,v) is the link-prediction probability that u invites v and v accepts.  
   – V(u,v,o) is the expected value on objective o if u and v form a connection.  
   – w(u,o) is how important objective o is for user u (e.g., how much they value professional overlap vs. social closeness).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Offline  
• Precision/Recall or Similar Ranking Metrics: How well do the recommended candidates match the connections that users actually form later?  
• Calibration of P(u,v): Are we accurately predicting acceptance probabilities?

Online  
• Invitation Acceptance Rate: Of the invite suggestions that are sent, how many result in accepted connections?  
• Engagement: Do newly formed connections lead to meaningful interactions (e.g., messages, shared content likes)?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Proposed PYMK Flow  
1. Candidate Generation: Identify potential connections (v) for user u.  
2. Feature Extraction: Compute features for (u, v) such as common schools, shared connections, overlapping skills.  
3. Link-Prediction Model: Estimate P(u,v) for each candidate pair.  
4. Value Model: Estimate V(u,v,o) for each relevant objective (e.g., potential interactions).  
5. Scoring & Ranking: Combine probability and value to produce a final rank-ordered list.  
6. Serving: Deliver top recommended connections in the “People You May Know” panel or email suggestions.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Data Sources  
• Member Features (f_u & f_v): Profile data, such as experience, skills, education, location.  
• Edge Features (f_uv): Common connections, how frequently user u and v appear in the same group or event, etc.  
• Historical Actions: Who has sent invitations to whom, acceptance patterns, subsequent post-connection interactions.  

Data Prep Steps  
• Aggregation of user-level and network-level attributes.  
• Cleaning & Normalizing: Standardize job titles, skill labels, and eliminate out-of-date or incomplete profiles.  
• Split into training/validation/test sets, ensuring coverage of many user segments (e.g., different locations, industries, levels of activity).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Link-Prediction Features  
• Common Friends: Count or weighted measure of shared connections.  
• Common Close Friends: Those with high interaction frequency.  
• Same School & Major: Education overlap.  
• Similar Skillsets: Based on skills or endorsements.  

Edge Features (f_uv)  
• Co-engagement signals: Have they “liked” or commented on the same posts/groups?  
• Network Overlap: Weighted by degrees of separation in the network graph.  

Value-Estimation Features  
• For V(u,v,o), consider how likely they are to view each other’s posts, message each other, or endorse each other’s skills.  
• Potential future interactions factor into the estimated value.

Textual Embeddings (Optional)  
• Job titles or skill descriptions can be processed into embeddings if more nuanced semantic matching is needed (e.g., fuzzy matching for “Data Scientist” vs. “Machine Learning Engineer”).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Link Prediction Model (P(u,v))  
   • Regression / GLM:  
     P(u,v) = λ( α^T f_u + β^T f_v + f_u^T A f_v + γ^T f_uv )  
   • Captures advanced interactions between user features (f_u), candidate features (f_v), and shared edge features (f_uv).  
   • Could also incorporate logistic regression or gradient boosted trees for more flexible modeling.

2. Value Model (V(u,v,o))  
   • A GLM or regression approach that estimates expected interactions if u and v connect:  
     V(u,v,o) = F( f_u, f_v, f_uv, Net_u, Act_v )  
   • Input includes user features, candidate features, current network structure, and candidate’s activity level.

Offline Evaluation Steps  
• Compute accuracy or calibration of P(u,v).  
• Evaluate if V(u,v,o) leads to correct ranking improvements (e.g., do higher-valued connections yield more real interactions?).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Serving Architecture  
• Candidate Generation: A large-scale pipeline that identifies all potential edges within certain constraints (e.g., up to 2 or 3 hops away in the network).  
• Feature Computation: Could be done offline or via near real-time caching if features update frequently.  
• Online Scoring & Ranking: Real-time or near real-time scoring of top candidates with the link-prediction and value models.  

System Requirements  
• Low latency: The “People You May Know” panel should load quickly on a user’s home page.  
• Scalability: Potentially billions of edges to evaluate, so consider approximate or incremental methods (e.g., indexing, caching partial predictions).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rollout & Experimentation  
• A/B Testing: Show new recommendations to a subset of users and measure acceptance rates, subsequent interactions.  
• Calibration Check: Track whether the predicted acceptance probabilities match actual acceptance behavior in real usage (bucketed by predicted probability ranges).

Monitoring  
• Track In-vitro vs. In-vivo performance: Compare offline test metrics to real-world acceptance rates.  
• Watch system health in production, including latency for generating recommendations.

───────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
───────────────
Scaling  
• Graph Partitioning or Sharding: Manage large-scale user graph computations, especially for multi-hop feature extraction.  
• Incremental Updates: As user profiles change or new connections form, refresh features in near real-time.

Monitoring  
• Drift Detection: If user behavior shifts (e.g., new occupation trends), ensure the link prediction model remains accurate.  
• Performance Dashboards: Monitor daily acceptance rates, number of suggestions shown, etc.

Model Updates  
• Periodically retrain models (P(u,v) and V(u,v,o)) on fresh data to reflect new members, new behaviors, and updated user attributes.  
• Explore advanced architectures (e.g., deep graph neural networks) or pairwise ranking approaches for better performance.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
By systematically following these nine steps—defining the “People You May Know” offering, establishing offline/online metrics, designing candidate generation and ranking logic, building link-prediction and value-estimation models, and finally deploying, testing, and refining—we can create a scalable LinkedIn PYMK system. The solution focuses on accurately predicting whether a proposed connection will be accepted and whether the connection leads to meaningful member interactions, thus driving genuine engagement on the platform.

## LinkedIn Course Recommendation

Below is an end-to-end plan for designing and deploying a “Learning Course Recommendation” system for LinkedIn Learning, following the same nine-step framework used in previous examples. This approach spans from identifying the problem and relevant metrics to final deployment and monitoring, highlighting key considerations for candidate generation, model training, and system scaling.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal  
• Recommend relevant LinkedIn Learning courses to users based on their skill profiles, career interests, and past engagement (for example, watched courses, saved courses).  
• Optimize for user engagement signals: clicks, course watch duration, saves, or completion.

Key Design Aims  
• Ensure that courses are vetted for alignment with user’s existing skill sets (or skill gaps).  
• Provide personalized rankings to encourage continuous learning on the platform.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Offline  
• AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve): Measures how well the classifier distinguishes between positive and negative engagement.  
• Precision / Recall at K or CTR in an offline test set.

Online  
• Click-Through Rate (CTR): Proportion of recommended courses clicked.  
• Completion or watch time: Do recommended courses keep the user’s interest?  
• Saves: Frequency of users bookmarking or saving a course to watch later.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
High-Level Flow  
1. Candidate Generation: Pull ~500–1,000 potential courses relevant to the user’s profile from multiple retrieval methods (skill affinity models, “courses similar to previously watched” approach, etc.).  
2. Ranking/Scoring: Use a ranking model to score these candidates based on user–course features, then sort them by predicted engagement likelihood.  
3. Offline Batch Scoring: Because preferences do not shift dramatically in real time for learning courses, offline scoring is sufficient for many use cases.  
4. Delivery: Serve the recommended course feed or recommendation widgets (e.g., on a user’s LinkedIn feed or within the LinkedIn Learning platform).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Data Sources  
• User Data: User’s declared and inferred skills, prior course engagements (watched minutes, completions), professional background.  
• Course Data: Tagged skills, textual descriptions, embedded transcripts, metadata about course length, difficulty, etc.  
• Engagement Logs: Interaction logs capturing clicks, watch duration, saves, “not interested” signals.

Data Preparation Steps  
• Label Generation: Collect positive labels (clicks, watch completions) and negative labels (impressions without clicks).  
• Train/Test/Validation Split: Ensure representation across different user segments (beginners, advanced learners, diverse skill areas).  
• Negative Sampling (optional): Downsample large volumes of negative interactions, plus random negative examples for a balanced training set.  
• Temporal Consistency: Use the correct versioned features for each data point, based on the date of user interaction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. User Features  
   • Skill Vectors: Summaries of user’s known/inferred skills.  
   • Learning History: Courses completed, partial completions, categories of interest.  
   • Professional Profile: Job title, industry, seniority, location.

2. Course Features  
   • Embedded Transcripts: Convert course text to embeddings to capture semantic information.  
   • Tagged Skills: Map course topics to LinkedIn’s skill taxonomy.  
   • Engagement Statistics: Overall course popularity, average watch time.  

3. User–Course Interaction Features  
   • Skill Overlap: The fraction of the user’s top skills that match the course’s skill tags.  
   • Historical Behavior: If the user has partially watched or saved related courses.  
   • Co-occurrence or Collaborative Filtering: Whether similar users to this user have engaged with the course.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Training Setup  
• Supervised approach to predict probability of engagement (click, watch, or save).  
• Distributed Model Training: Leverage Spark or another framework to handle large-scale data.  

Label Definition  
• Typical label = (clicked or watched) vs. not clicked.  
• Weighted or multi-label approach if we combine different engagement signals.

Offline Evaluation  
• Calculate AUC, Precision@K, CTR in validation.  
• Possibly measure coverage: Are we making relevant recommendations for diverse sets of users/courses?

Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Selection  
• Model types could include Gradient-Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM) or deep neural networks.  
• Fine-tune learning rate, tree depth, embeddings dimension, etc.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Offline or Near Real-time Scoring  
• Offline Batch Scoring:  
  – The model processes new user–course pairs once daily (or more often) and writes the scores to a key-value store.  
  – Low-latency retrieval of precomputed scores whenever a user visits the recommendation page.  
• Online (On-demand) Scoring (If needed):  
  – For users with sudden skill updates or new platform activity, run partial or on-demand inference.

Latency & Reliability  
• Typically, user tolerance for a course recommendation page can allow a short delay.  
• Scaling considerations around large item (course) catalog and user base require a distributed approach to store and serve feature data.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A/B Testing  
• Present existing recommendation logic to one group and the new model-based recommendations to another.  
• Compare CTR, watch duration, completion rates between the two groups over the same time period.

Rollout Plan  
• If results are promising (e.g., improved CTR or watch time), expand the rollout to more users.  
• Continue monitoring to ensure stable performance and user satisfaction.

Cold Start Considerations  
• For brand-new users (or those with limited engagement history), fallback to:  
  – Popular or trending courses.  
  – Basic skill-based suggestions from the user’s job title or declared skills.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scaling  
• Data Pipeline: A daily streaming or batch pipeline that merges new user logs, updated course info, and runs the scoring function.  
• Sharding/Replication: For large numbers of courses, store them in memory with replicated shards so that each reducer handles a subset but can scale horizontally.

Monitoring  
• Real-time dashboards for CTR, watch duration, any error rates.  
• Automated alerts if metrics degrade significantly (e.g., drops in watch rates).

Model Updates  
• Retrain regularly (daily, weekly) to incorporate new user activities and new courses.  
• Periodically verify that the model remains well-calibrated and relevant to emerging trends or skill demands.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Summary  
By organizing this LinkedIn Learning Course Recommendation system into nine structured steps—from problem definition to metric tracking, data pipelines, feature engineering, model training, deployment, and iterative improvements—teams can deliver highly relevant learning content, driving user engagement and professional growth. The system’s batch or near real-time approach, combined with robust candidate generation and ranking methods, ensures personalized and scalable recommendations for millions of learners on the platform.

## Uber ETA Prediction

Below is a nine-step, end-to-end perspective on designing and deploying an ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) prediction system at Uber. This framework addresses all major considerations, from problem definition and data handling to real-time inference and continual improvements.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal  
• Predict accurate trip ETAs (estimated times of arrival) for any route request, across multiple lines of business (ride-hailing, delivery, etc.).  
• Integrate with existing routing engines, using an ML model as a post-processing step on top of the standard routing-based ETA.

Key Requirements  
• Latency: Return predictions in a few milliseconds at scale, allowing real-time integration with in-app displays.  
• Accuracy: Reduce mean absolute error (MAE) beyond the existing baseline (e.g., XGBoost).  
• Generality: Must work globally (urban, rural) and across diverse trip segments (pickup, dropoff, short/long, ride, or delivery).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Offline  
• MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted ETAs and actual times.  
• Asymmetric Huber Loss (or an equivalent): Sensitive to outliers, but can be tuned to penalize large under- or over-predictions differently.

Online  
• Real-Time MAE or MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Evaluate production predictions vs. actual timestamps.  
• Trip-Level Feedback Signals: Negative user feedback or routine reevaluation if driver or courier arrives significantly earlier/later than predicted.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
System Overview  
1. Routing Engine Output: Returns a base route (road segments) and a baseline ETA.  
2. ML Model (DeepETA): Takes features from the route engine (distance, speed, traffic patterns) plus additional metadata (time of day, local conditions) and produces an ETA adjustment (the “residual”).  
3. Final ETA: Combined as ETA = max(RawRoutingETA + Residual, 0).  

Requirements  
• Must embed geospatial and traffic data in a manner that generalizes to new locations and routes.  
• Must handle real-time volume for peak usage periods with minimal latency.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Data Sources  
• Historical Trip Data: Start/end points, route polylines, actual travel durations.  
• Traffic / Road Network: Real-time traffic feeds, historical average speeds for each street segment or time block.  
• Contextual Data: Time of day, day of week, ride type (personal vs. shared), or short vs. long trips.  

Data Preprocessing  
• Clean & Validate: Remove incomplete or anomalous trips (e.g., driver cancellations).  
• Feature Transformation: Bucket continuous features (e.g., distance, speed) into quantile buckets and embed them.  
• Train/Validation/Test Splits: Typically partition by time windows or geographies to capture real-world distribution.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Continuous Features  
   • Raw Routing Engine’s ETA, distance, average speed.  
   • Current traffic speed or congestion index.  
   • Time-based features (e.g., hour-of-day).  

   → Apply quantile binning, then map to embedding vectors.

2. Categorical/Discrete Features  
   • City or region IDs, ride category (delivery vs. ride), trip segment type (pickup vs. dropoff).  
   • Driver/courier historical metrics (optional).  

   → Implement embedding or hashing strategies for large cardinalities (e.g., location IDs).

3. Geospatial Features  
   • Segment-level IDs of route polylines.  
   • Feature hashing or hierarchical tiling schemes to handle large geographies.  

4. Derived Features  
   • Interaction of trip length category (short/long) with time-of-day.  
   • Segment bias (pickup vs. dropoff residual times).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Model Architecture (DeepETA)  
• Encoder–Decoder Paradigm:  
  – Encoder: Stacks linear transformer or feedforward layers on top of embeddings for continuous/categorical features.  
  – Decoder: One or more fully connected layers producing a final regression output.  
• Loss Function: Asymmetric Huber Loss to handle outliers and penalize under/-over-estimations appropriately.  
• Additional Bias Adjustments: Some segments (e.g., airport pickups) might need special offsets.

Offline Training Flow (Often Spark-based)  
• Feature Prep → Feature Transform → Model Train → Evaluate → Deploy.  
• Evaluate metrics like MAE, median error, or quantile-based errors (95th percentile) to ensure robust coverage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Real-Time Inference  
• “uRoute” or an equivalent front-end service:  
  – Receives user’s trip request.  
  – Calls routing engine for path and base ETA.  
  – Sends features to Michelangelo or a similar online prediction service for the residual estimate.  
• Combine the raw ETA + model’s predicted adjustment, ensuring that final output is non-negative.

Latency Considerations  
• Must respond within a few milliseconds given large scale concurrency.  
• Typically aided by feature caches (e.g., up-to-date traffic speeds) and optimized model-serving infrastructure (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, PyTorch TorchServe, or Uber’s internal Michelangelo system).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rollout & Experimentation  
• A/B Testing: Show a percentage of users an ETA from DeepETA vs. an existing baseline (e.g., XGBoost) and compare real-time errors.  
• Region-Specific Tests: Begin deployment in select cities or geographies to confirm performance generalization.

Monitoring  
• Keep streaming logs of actual trip times vs. predicted ETAs.  
• Watch for systematic bias (e.g., consistent underestimation in certain neighborhoods).

Rollback Strategy  
• If the new model causes large negative user feedback or error spikes, quickly revert to the baseline model.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scalability  
• Horizontal Autoscaling: For high-traffic times, spin up more serving instances or ephemeral GPU resources if needed.  
• Data Infrastructure: Handle billions of trip data points across time zones, requiring efficient partitioning or caching schemes.

Monitoring & Alerting  
• Track key metrics in real time: average/or median trip-time discrepancy, 90th or 95th percentile errors.  
• Alert if predictions degrade by more than a threshold (e.g., +15% in error vs. baseline).

Periodic Retraining  
• Schedule daily or weekly batch jobs to feed new trip data into the pipeline.  
• Validate the newly trained model offline using the latest data; only push to production if it outperforms the current model’s metrics.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Summary  
By walking through these nine steps—defining the ETA prediction problem, choosing the right error metrics, constructing an encoder–decoder neural architecture fed by routing engine data, and deploying in a high-availability environment—Uber can deliver more accurate real-time ETAs. The combination of robust feature engineering (quantile transformations, embedding) and continual retraining ensures that the system remains responsive to evolving traffic patterns, geographies, and user behaviors.

## Youtube Video Recommendation

Below is a nine-step end-to-end framework for building and deploying a YouTube-style video recommendation system. It draws from the concepts discussed—two-stage retrieval/ranking architecture, large-scale data pipelines, robust feature engineering, and the importance of balancing relevance with exploration to accommodate emerging or viral content.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal  
• Recommend a personalized set of YouTube videos to each user at home-page load (or similar feed).  
• Maximize user engagement (e.g., clicks, watch time), while preserving diversity and giving new or less-known videos a chance to surface.  

Key Constraints  
• Latency: Generate 100 recommended videos per user in under 100–200 ms.  
• Scalability: System must handle billions of videos and over a billion users.  
• Rapidly Changing Content: Must retrain or refresh daily (or multiple times per day) to capture trends and viral videos.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Offline Metrics  
• Precision & Recall: Evaluate how many “positive” items (videos actually watched or clicked) appear in the recommended set.  
• Ranking Loss & Logloss: Used to assess how well the model ranks positive items over negative ones.  

Online Metrics  
• CTR (Click-Through Rate): Fraction of recommended videos actually clicked.  
• Watch Time: Total or average minutes watched after click.  
• Conversion Rate: Could be subscriptions to a channel, likes, or other deeper engagement actions.  

Complexities  
• Trade-off between high user engagement metrics vs. discovering fresh content (exploration vs. exploitation).  
• Frequent A/B testing to measure improvements in CTR, watch time, etc.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two-Stage Architecture  
1. Candidate Generation:  
   – Takes a user’s recent watch history (and possibly broader user features).  
   – Retrieves a few hundred candidate videos from a massive catalog (millions to billions).  
   – Often uses collaborative filtering or matrix factorization approaches for fast similarity-based retrieval.  

2. Ranking:  
   – Receives the “short list” (hundreds) of candidate videos.  
   – Computes a refined relevance probability (e.g., watch probability, watch time).  
   – Returns the top N (e.g., 10–100) videos to the user.  

This two-stage approach balances efficiency (fast large-scale retrieval) with accuracy (precise final ordering).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Data Sources  
• User–Video DB: Contains user profiles, watch logs, and video metadata (titles, descriptions, categories).  
• Watch History DB: Tracks each user’s watch sessions, watch durations, partial completions, search queries.  
• Search Query DB: Stores historical queries typed by users to discover content.  

Data Preparation Steps  
• Label Generation: Positive labels from observed user views/clicks, negative labels from shown-but-not-watched or random negative sampling.  
• Timeline Restrictions: Use 1–6 months of data for training to keep the dataset fresh, archiving older data in cold storage.  
• Downsampling: Because 98%+ of user-video pairs are negative, reduce negative examples for more balanced training while preserving distribution signals (e.g., ratio of 2:98 → 1:1 in training).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Candidate Generation Feature Set  
• Matrix Factorization / Collaborative Filtering:  
  – Map users to embedding vectors, videos to embedding vectors.  
  – Similar users or video–video correlations drive candidate retrieval.  

• Content-Based Features (Optional):  
  – Video transcript keywords, categories, channel metadata, etc.  

Ranking Model Feature Set  
• User Embeddings: Aggregated from watch history, demographic data, location.  
• Video Embeddings: Learned from metadata, content, or jointly in a two-tower network.  
• Historical Search Queries: Embedded text from user search logs.  
• Contextual Features: Time of day, day of week, device type, recency of last session.  
• Exploration Signals: Flags or randomization parameters to ensure new videos have exposure.

Standard Transformations  
• Normalization / Standardization for continuous features (e.g., watch counts).  
• Embedding or hashing for high-cardinality categorical features (video IDs, location, etc.).  
• Time-based features encoded with cyclical transformations or standard one-hot for day/hour.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Candidate Generation Model  
• Often a collaborative filtering approach (e.g., matrix factorization) or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) over user–video embeddings.  
• Low-dimensional user/video vectors allow fast retrieval of top-K similar videos.  

Ranking Model  
• Could be a deep learning model, e.g., DCNv2, or a simpler logistic regression/GBDT for interpretability.  
• Final layer: Sigmoid activation for watch probability or click probability output.  
• Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy (logistic) or alternative focal losses for class imbalance, plus partial watch time predictions.  

Offline Evaluation  
• Precision@K, Recall@K for recommended sets.  
• Logloss or ranking-based metrics (e.g., NDCG).  
• Watch time correlation: Evaluate if predicted watch time matches real usage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Real-Time Serving Flow  
1. User arrives on homepage → Request hits Load Balancer.  
2. Application Server calls Candidate Generation Service, which queries user/video embeddings or collaborative filters to retrieve ~100–1,000 candidate videos.  
3. Ranking Service is invoked with the short-listed candidates.  
4. Ranking Model fetches user-level features (e.g., watch history), video-level features, and context features to compute watch probability or watch time predictions.  
5. The top N recommendations are returned to the Application Server, which sends them to the user’s interface.

Latency Constraints  
• Sub-100ms or 200ms budget to generate final recommendations.  
• Scaling horizontally with more servers for peak load (Kubernetes or similar approach for container orchestration).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Continuous Model Updates  
• Retrain multiple times a day to capture shifts in user interests or newly uploaded trending videos.  
• Deploy new candidate generation and ranking models behind feature flags or canary releases.

A/B Testing  
• Compare new model vs. old model in terms of CTR, average watch time, bounce rate.  
• Monitor differences in user sentiment or watch distribution (are new categories still shown?).

Exploration vs. Exploitation  
• Consider partial randomization or multi-armed bandit strategies to ensure new or long-tail videos get occasional exposure.  
• Adjust exploration weight for new or less-engaged channels.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scalability  
• Billions of rows per month (potentially 800B+ interactions).  
• Spark or similar large-scale data processing frameworks for daily or near real-time feature extraction.  
• Model stores (e.g., S3 or internal data lake) for versioned models and rollback.  

Monitoring  
• Real-Time Dashboards: CTR, watch time, daily active users, tail-latency metrics.  
• Error Reporting: Spot-check if retrieval or ranking services degrade in performance (time outs, memory spikes).

Retraining & Iterative Improvement  
• Re-run training pipelines on fresh data, re-balancing negative sampling if distribution skews.  
• Adjust hyperparameters and architecture (e.g., deeper networks, wider embeddings) to handle new video categories or user behaviors.  
• Introduce domain-specific features (e.g., fresh breakout channels) to handle user novelty preferences.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Summary  
These nine steps illustrate how YouTube can combine a two-stage approach (candidate generation + ranking) with powerful feature engineering, balanced metric tracking, and a robust serving infrastructure. The system must handle massive data throughput, low-latency inferences, and frequent retraining—thereby ensuring that each user sees engaging, relevant recommendations while the platform continually adapts to shifting content trends and user tastes.

## LinkedIn Feed Ranking

Below is a suggested end-to-end plan for building and deploying a personalized LinkedIn feed ranking system to maximize long-term user engagement. The narrative is organized according to the nine design steps, illustrating how to handle everything from problem formulation to monitoring and model updates.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Problem Formulation 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The primary objective is to personalize the LinkedIn feed for each user such that we maximize long-term engagement. We focus on predicting the click-through rate (CTR) of various activities in a user’s feed. The key considerations are:

• Different activity types (e.g., Connection, Informational, Profile, Opinion, Site-Specific) each have their own CTR distribution.  
• Large user base (hundreds of millions), requiring high scalability.  
• Data freshness to avoid repetitive content or stale activity in users’ feeds.  
• The most direct measurement of engagement is whether a user clicks an item (CTR), but “downstream” engagement (e.g., likes, comments, shares) could also be considered.

Ultimately, the model will be a supervised binary classifier estimating the likelihood of a user clicking (or otherwise engaging with) a given post.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2. Metrics (Offline and Online) 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2.1 Offline Metrics  
• Normalized Cross Entropy (NCE): Commonly used so that the model is less sensitive to the baseline CTR.  
• AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve): Helps evaluate how well the classification model separates clicks vs. non-clicks over a variety of thresholds.

2.2 Online Metrics  
• CTR and conversion rate, measured once the model is in production, to reflect actual user interactions.  
• Engagement metrics: includes downstream signals like dwell time, shares, comments, etc.  
• Long-term engagement: usage frequency, session length, returning visits.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic) 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
At a high level, we have:

• Client (LinkedIn’s frontend)—where user requests originate (desktop or mobile).  
• Application Server—receives incoming feed requests, orchestrates calls to backend services.  
• Feed Service—performs the main retrieval and ranking logic. It:  
  1) Fetches candidate feed items from an Item Store.  
  2) Gathers features from a Feature Store.  
  3) Retrieves the latest model from a Model Store to score candidates.  
  4) Returns ranked results to the Application Server.  
• Feature Store—stores precomputed features (e.g., user embedding, item embedding, recency).  
• Model Store—manages and serves the latest feed-ranking model.  
• Logging Service—collects data about user actions (click, scroll, like, share, etc.) for further training.  
• Model Training environment—uses logs and raw data to train or retrain the models.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. Data Collection and Preparation 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Because LinkedIn’s feed involves many types of activities across a large user base, we must:

• Gather historical user behavior: clicks, impressions, profile updates, connections.  
• Include negative feedback examples (impressions with no clicks).  
• Address distribution shift: user behavior changes over time, new types of posts appear.  

Data collection approaches:
• Some controlled randomness in the feed so that the model isn’t only exposed to the “top 5” items.  
• Deduplicate or filter out repeated items to avoid user fatigue.

Data pre-processing:
• Clean invalid or bot-like events.  
• Ensure consistent timestamp alignment so the correct user features are used at the time of each impression.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5. Feature Engineering 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5.1 User Features  
• Demographics: industry, job title, region.  
• Behavioral: how often the user interacts with posts (like frequency, comment frequency).  
• Connection graph: user embedding or similarity-based features referencing connections.

5.2 Activity/Post Features  
• Type/category of the post (Connection vs. Informational vs. Profile updates).  
• Embeddings for text, images, hashtags.  
• Recency/age of activity (binned or continuous).

5.3 Interaction/Cross Features  
• User × Post similarity: e.g., content-based embedding similarity.  
• Cross features (e.g., user’s industry + post’s topic).  
• Time-of-day interactions.

Because we need both dense (embeddings) and sparse (categorical) features, we store them in the Feature Store with well-defined schemas (e.g., “industry_id,” “post_embedding_vector”).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6.1 Modeling Approaches  
• Logistic Regression (distributed on Spark) to start simple.  
• Deep Neural Network with fully connected layers and a sigmoid output layer for CTR prediction.

6.2 Handling Imbalanced Data  
• CTR is ~1%. Use negative downsampling to reduce negative data points.  
• Keep validation/test sets intact to correctly measure performance.

6.3 Loss Functions and Evaluations  
• Use Normalized Cross Entropy (NCE) or logistic loss.  
• Evaluate with offline metrics: AUC, NCE on holdout sets.  
• Replay evaluation: reorder items for user impressions in historical logs beyond time T, and compare predicted clicks to actual clicks.

6.4 Model Retraining Strategy  
• Large data demands distributed infrastructure.  
• Frequent retraining or incremental training to handle concept drift.  
• Evaluate different retraining frequencies: daily vs. multiple times daily.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7. Prediction Service 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
At inference time:

1) User visits LinkedIn and requests the feed from the Application Server.  
2) Feed Service:  
   a. Queries the Item Store for candidate posts.  
   b. Fetches user features from the Feature Store.  
   c. Retrieves the most recent ranking model from the Model Store.  
   d. Scores each candidate to generate CTR predictions.  
   e. Sorts the candidates by predicted click probability.  
3) The sorted results are returned back through the Application Server to the client.

Latency Constraints:
• End-to-end feed generation must be within ~200ms.  
• Model scoring typically given a budget of ~50ms; efficient feature retrieval and model inference are critical.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
8. Online Testing and Deployment 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
8.1 Deployment Process  
• Canary release or A/B test the new model on a small percentage of traffic to ensure correctness/stability.  
• Gradually roll out to larger user cohorts as performance meets thresholds.

8.2 Online Testing and Metrics  
• Track CTR, dwell time, and sign-ups/conversions if relevant.  
• Monitor for significant changes in user engagement or performance anomalies.  
• If performance degrades, decide to roll back or retrain.

8.3 User Experience Considerations  
• Avoid feed fatigue: push down or remove repeated items.  
• Sensitivity to trending or time-sensitive posts for professional contexts (e.g., job announcements).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
9.1 Scaling  
• Scale out horizontally:  
  – Application Servers behind a load balancer.  
  – Feed Service replicated to handle large parallel requests.  
  – Distributed storage for features, items, and logs.  
• Efficient caching of popular item features or user embeddings.  
• Sharding logic in the Feature Store so it can serve updates with low latency.

9.2 Monitoring  
• Track key performance indicators: latency, throughput, error rates.  
• Real-time dashboards for system health: CPU, memory usage, and query response times.  
• Monitor offline vs. online CTR consistency to detect drift.

9.3 Continuous Model Updates  
• Frequent or incremental training pipeline triggered by new data.  
• Automated pipeline logs data → processes features → retrains model → performs offline validation → deploys if improvements are observed.  
• Archival of older data in cold storage to reduce costs, while retaining enough recent data for training.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Conclusion 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
By systematically following these steps—formulating the problem as a binary classification task, choosing appropriate offline and online metrics, designing an extensible architecture, carefully gathering/preparing data, engineering robust features, building and evaluating models, deploying a responsive prediction service, running online tests, and establishing thoughtful scaling and monitoring strategies—you can build a sophisticated feed ranking system for LinkedIn-style user engagement. This approach ensures both near-term performance and long-term adaptability as user behavior and platform content evolve.

## Facebook Ad Click Prediction

Below is a step‐by‐step narrative outlining how you might implement and deploy an end‐to‐end click‐through rate (CTR) prediction system for advertisements. The goal is to highlight both the high‐level architecture and the more detailed machine learning (ML) engineering aspects. We will follow the nine steps given:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Problem Formulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this task, our goal is to predict whether an ad will be clicked by a user in an online advertising system. The problem is inherently a binary classification problem (clicked or not clicked), but it requires extra care due to:

• High data volume: Billions of ad impressions per month.  
• Highly imbalanced dataset: Typical CTR ranges from 1% to 2%.  
• Latency constraints: Predictions must be generated within 50–100ms.  

Additionally, the ad-serving environment is a waterfall model where publishers cascade their inventory from high-CPM deals to lower-tier networks, and ensuring fast and accurate predictions is paramount.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Offline Metrics  
• Normalized Cross Entropy (NCE):  
  NCE = ( −(1/N) ∑ [ (1+yᵢ)/2 · log(pᵢ) + (1−yᵢ)/2 · log(1−pᵢ) ] )  
         / [ − ( p·log(p) + (1−p)·log(1−p) ) ]

  This metric is a variation of log loss, normalized by the cross‐entropy of the background CTR.

• Calibration: We measure how close the predicted probability of clicks (expected clicks) is to the actual observed clicks.

Online Metrics  
• Revenue Lift: We monitor gains or losses in revenue over a period of time using an A/B testing approach.  
• Incremental CTR or ROI lift: Although not explicitly listed, systems often track additional business or engagement metrics to ensure improved real‐world performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a high level, the system consists of:  
• Ads Candidate Generation Service – Gets a pool of candidate ads from various networks.  
• Features Store – Serves features (e.g., user profiles, advertiser info, historical stats).  
• Ads Ranking Service – Uses a trained ML model to rank or score candidate ads based on click probability.  
• Model Store – Versioned storage for trained models.  
• Aggregator Service (optional at scale) – If the list of ad candidates is huge, an aggregator will parallelize calls to multiple ranker instances and merge the final results.

MVP Flow (simplified):  
1. Ads Candidate Generation Service provides a set of ads to show.  
2. The system retrieves or computes features for each ad-user pair from the Features Store.  
3. Our ranking model (CTR predictor) scores each ad.  
4. Ads are ranked, and the top ads are returned to the user.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Data Collection and Preparation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Sources  
• Logs Data (User clicks, impressions, conversions, etc.).  
• Event‐Driven Data (e.g., via Kafka streams capturing real-time user behavior).  
• Offline Data Lake (historical data stored in a scalable file store such as HDFS or cloud-based storage).  

Data Flow  
1. Batch Data Preparation:  
   – Large ETL jobs (e.g., with Spark) extract and transform historical data.  
   – Store structured training data in the Training Data Store.  

2. Streaming Data Pipeline:  
   – Processes real‐time user events (e.g., how many ads they clicked in the last hour).  
   – Updates the Features Store (often a key‐value store) for low‐latency feature retrieval.  

Partitioning Data  
• Because we want to simulate a real production environment, we partition training and validation sets by time (e.g., train on one week, validate on the next day).  
• CTR is <2%, so the dataset is highly imbalanced. We may employ negative subsampling strategies (e.g., keep 10% of negative samples, keep all positive samples).  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Feature Engineering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Feature Types  
• AdvertiserID:  
  – Could be large (thousands to millions). Feature hashing or embeddings can be used to transform these IDs into a lower-dimensional space.  

• Temporal Features:  
  – day_of_week, time_of_day, or seasonality features in one‐hot or cyclical encodings.  

• User Behavior:  
  – Historical ad‐click count, average CTR over past sessions, recency/frequency of clicks.  
  – These can be aggregated over sliding windows (e.g., last hour, last day, last week).  

• User Similarity:  
  – Embeddings or collaborative filtering features that represent how similar a given user is to other users.  

• Cross Features:  
  – Combining user device type with user operating system, or combining time features with advertiser categories.  

Data Sampling  
• We must ensure the validation set has the same distribution as real production data.  
• Negative subsampling is common to handle the large volume of negative samples.  

Calibration  
• After training, apply calibration techniques (e.g., Platt scaling or Isotonic regression) so that predicted probabilities match observed frequencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model Choices  
• Logistic Regression (Sparse & Probabilistic):  
  – Highly efficient, handles very sparse high‐dimensional data (advertiser/user IDs).  
  – Straightforward to retrain frequently.  

• DCNv2 (Deep Cross Network):  
  – A more advanced architecture combining deep layers with feature crossing.  
  – Good for capturing higher-order interactions among user, ad, context features.  

Training  
• Negative subsampling to address imbalance.  
• Optimize with a suitable loss (binary cross‐entropy or a loss function that approximates ranking performance).  
• Hyperparameter tuning (regularization coefficients, learning rate in deeper models, etc.).  

Offline Evaluation  
• Compute NCE and calibration metrics.  
• Conduct repeated experiments with different sampling ratios.  
• Watch for overfitting by verifying performance on a time‐based validation set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Prediction Service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Serving Architecture  
• Model Retrieval: A Model Service that loads the latest stable model from the Model Store.  
• Ad Ranking Service: Accepts user‐ad feature vectors and calls the model’s predict function.  
• Latency Budget: 50–100ms. Must handle up to 40k or more ad requests per second.  

Typical Steps  
1. The user’s request arrives with ad candidates.  
2. For each ad candidate, features are fetched from the Features Store.  
3. The ranking model computes p(click) for each candidate ad.  
4. Ads are ranked based on predicted CTR or predicted revenue.  
5. Top ads are returned.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Online Testing and Model Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A/B Testing  
• Deploy new model to a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 1–5%).  
• Track revenue lift and CTR improvements over a statistically significant period.  
• Gradually increase traffic share if performance meets thresholds.  

Canary Release Strategy  
• Deploy model to a single “canary” server or region to ensure stable performance.  
• Roll out to entire cluster if no issues arise.  

Continuous/Incremental Deployment  
• Since CTR distributions can shift quickly, we may have frequent model updates (daily or more often).  
• Automated pipelines can trigger retraining (batch or streaming) and deployment with minimal manual intervention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scaling  
• Aggregator Service: If 50k–100k candidates per request is too big, break it up and parallelize ranking across multiple model-serving instances. Then aggregate partial results.  
• Horizontal Scaling of the Ranking Service: Spin up more instances behind a load balancer to handle peak QPS (queries per second).  

Monitoring  
• Latency Dashboards: Ensure 95th or 99th percentile latency remains below 100ms.  
• Model Performance: Monitor online CTR, revenue, or other KPIs.  
• Error Rates: Check for unexpected spikes in server errors or timeouts.  

Updates  
• Model Retraining: Automated jobs (spark jobs) that refresh the training dataset daily or multiple times per day.  
• Feature Store Refresh: The streaming pipeline continuously keeps user stats up to date.  
• Model Versioning: Roll back to a previous version quickly if new model underperforms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By tying these nine steps together, you tell a cohesive story: you begin by clarifying the predictive problem and success metrics (Steps 1 and 2), outline the core system architecture and the MVP approach (Steps 3 and 7), carefully design data flow and feature engineering (Steps 4 and 5), develop and evaluate your model offline (Step 6), then test and deploy your new model in production (Step 8), finally monitoring and scaling the entire system to meet real‐world demand (Step 9). This thorough design and implementation framework helps ensure your ad click prediction system is both accurate and robust under large‐scale, latency‐critical conditions.

## AirBnB Listing Ranking

Below is a structured walkthrough of how one might architect, develop, deploy, and scale an Airbnb Rental Search Ranking system that prioritizes the probability of a rental home being booked. The solution narrative follows nine key steps, from initial problem formulation to full-scale deployment and monitoring.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Problem Formulation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The goal of Airbnb’s search ranking is to sort rental listings so that the most “bookable” homes appear at the top of the results page.

• Business Need:
  – Users want to find the most relevant listings quickly. 
  – As a business, Airbnb wants to maximize conversions (bookings).

• Machine Learning Angle:
  – Rather than ranking purely by text similarity to user search terms, we aim to rank listings based on their likelihood of being booked (binary classification: booked vs. not-booked).

• Key Constraints:
  – Ultra-low latency (within 200 ms) when returning top results from thousands of candidates.
  – Large-scale data: hundreds of millions of users, billions of search events.

• Typical Workflow:
  1. A user searches for a location/date range.
  2. The system retrieves a list of potentially relevant listings.
  3. A ML model assigns a booking probability to each listing.
  4. The listings are ranked based on these scores and returned to the user.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Metrics (Offline and Online)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Choosing the right metrics is critical to track effectiveness and guide improvements.

2.1 Offline Metrics
────────────────────
• NDCG@k (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at rank k):
  – Emphasizes correctly ranking top results (likely to be booked) higher.
  – Incorporates the concept of discounting for lower ranks, ensuring that the most relevant (booked) listings have higher weight when they appear in the top positions.

• Why Use NDCG?
  – Booking is often a sparse signal; the gain from each relevant listing is highest at the top ranks. 
  – It’s a robust metric to compare offline ranking experiments.

2.2 Online Metrics
───────────────────
• Conversion Rate (CR):
  – Measures how often users actually book from the recommended listings.
  – CR = (## of bookings) / (## of search results sent).

• Revenue Lift:
  – Measures net increase in revenue when using the new ranking vs. a baseline.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Architectural Components (MVP Logic)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Before scaling to millions of users, define an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) pipeline:

1. Frontend / Application Server: Receives the user’s query.
2. Search Service: Retrieves candidate listings using an inverted index or basic filters (location, date, availability, etc.).
3. Ranking Service (ML Model): Assigns a score to each candidate (the probability of booking).
4. Final Re-Ranking & Response: Sorts the returned listings by score and sends them back to the user.

MVP Flow:
1. Input: user query (location, date range, ## of guests, personal preferences).
2. Candidate retrieval: fetch up to a few thousand listings with basic filters.
3. Model-based scoring & ranking: return top listings sorted by predicted booking likelihood.
4. Logging: store served results to generate training data (user click, listing view, and booking actions).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Collection and Preparation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4.1 Data Sources
────────────────
• User Search & View Logs: 
  – Tracks user-level data (search queries, clicks, time spent on listing pages).
• Booking & Transaction Data: 
  – The ground-truth labels (booked = 1, not-booked = 0).
• Listing Metadata:
  – Listing attributes (location, number of rooms, amenities).
• Historical Context:
  – Seasonal trends, holiday spikes, user segmentation patterns (business vs. leisure travelers).

4.2 Data Splitting Strategy
────────────────────────────
• Time-Based Split:
  – Mimic production usage by using older data for training and more recent data for validation/testing.
  – Example: Train on past 6 months, validate on data from the subsequent weeks.

4.3 Handling Imbalanced Data
────────────────────────────
• Class Ratios:
  – Bookings are relatively rare. Consider oversampling or undersampling, or using class weights in the loss function to handle imbalance.
• Session Integrity:
  – Group by session so as not to mix partial user flows across train/validation sets.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Feature Engineering
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

High-quality features improve model performance significantly:

• Listing Features
  – Numerical: Price, number of bedrooms, rating, distance from city center (possibly logged or bucketed).
  – Categorical: City, neighborhood, property type, amenity list (encoded with multi-hot vectors).

• Geographical Features
  – Convert lat/long to distance from the user’s searched point of interest. 
  – Potentially use a grid-based or region-based encoding to capture neighborhood preferences.

• User Features
  – Past booking frequency, average length of stay, time since last booking.
  – Demographics (age, gender) where applicable and if user consent & privacy policies allow.

• Time Features
  – Day of week, month/season, holidays, hour of day.

• Embeddings
  – ListingID Embeddings: Challenge with new listing IDs. Feature hashing or fallback to average embedding for unseen IDs.
  – User Queries: Text embeddings (e.g., using word2vec or transformers) to capture semantic similarity to listing descriptions.

• Normalization and Scaling
  – For continuous features (price, distance), use standard scaling or min-max normalization.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Model Development and Offline Evaluation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.1 Model Approach
──────────────────
• Binary Classification: Predict whether a user will book a specific listing (1) or not (0).
• Potential Algorithms:
  – Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM): Often strong baseline for tabular data.
  – Deep Learning: Two-tower model (user tower and listing tower) that each produce embeddings, then combine them to generate a likelihood score.

6.2 Iterative Development
─────────────────────────
• Baseline Model: 
  – Start with simpler logistic regression or gradient boosting. Gather offline metrics (AUC, NDCG).
• Advanced Models:
  – As data grows, shift to deep neural networks with embeddings for user & listing features.

6.3 Offline Evaluation
──────────────────────
• Cross-Validation:
  – Time-based or block-based cross-validation to ensure consistent performance over time.
• Metrics Report:
  – Primary: nDCG@k (focus on top k results).
  – Secondary: AUC, Precision/Recall for additional insights.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. Prediction Service
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7.1 Serving Infrastructure
──────────────────────────
• Low-Latency Prediction:
  – Model must respond in under 50–100 ms for real-time user queries.
  – Store the model in a Model Store; load it into a highly optimized inference layer (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, ONNX Runtime, or a custom microservice).

7.2 Caching Strategies
──────────────────────
• Popular Destinations:
  – Cache scores for top listings in frequently searched regions or prime travel dates. 
• Embedding Lookup:
  – Precompute or store user and listing embeddings in a fast lookup store (e.g., Redis).

7.3 Feature Store
─────────────────
• Consistency Between Train and Serve:
  – Maintain a pipeline or a Feature Store that ensures real-time features match those used in offline training.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8. Online Testing and Model Deployment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

8.1 Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying new model versions. 
• Canary Deployments:
  – Roll out to a small percentage of traffic before a full launch to mitigate risk.

8.2 A/B Testing
────────────────
• Test the new model vs. a control group using metrics like conversion rate, revenue.
• Evaluate performance across multiple segments (device types, geographies).

8.3 Monitoring Performance
──────────────────────────
• Real-Time Dashboards:
  – Track latencies, error rates, and key business metrics (bookings, average revenue per search). 
• Alerting:
  – Set up triggers for abnormal dips in conversion rate or spikes in prediction latency.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. Scaling, Monitoring, and Updates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Once product-market fit is achieved and traffic expands, the following considerations come into play:

9.1 Scaling the Components
──────────────────────────
• Application Servers:
  – Scale horizontally behind load balancers (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer).
• Search & Ranking Services:
  – Deploy multiple replicas and partition or shard the data to handle higher request volumes.
• Logging Infrastructure:
  – Use Kafka or a cloud pub/sub system to collect real-time events (user clicks, bookings, etc.). 
  – Process logs offline to generate training sets.

9.2 Model Retraining Strategy
─────────────────────────────
• Frequency:
  – Retrain daily or weekly depending on data freshness and user behavior changes. 
• Handling New Listings:
  – Use fallback embeddings or cold-start logic (e.g., average of similar listings in the same neighborhood).

9.3 Performance Monitoring and Iteration
─────────────────────────────────────────
• Model Drift Detection:
  – Watch out for changes in user behavior. If drift is detected, trigger a retraining or new feature engineering. 
• Feature Updates:
  – Incorporate new signals like listing “view time” or user watchlist behavior. 
• Incremental Improvement:
  – Conduct online experiments to verify improvements in booking rate, revenue, or user satisfaction.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Final Thoughts
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Through the steps above, we have:  
1. Defined the ranking problem as a binary classification (booking vs. not booking).  
2. Explored offline (nDCG@k) and online metrics (conversion rate, revenue impact).  
3. Built an MVP architecture that can scale with user traffic.  
4. Collected and engineered crucial features (listing metadata, user history, time signals).  
5. Developed a low-latency inference service.  
6. Designed an iterative A/B testing and archival system for continuous improvement.  
7. Outlined a strategy for scaling and keeping the system robust over time.  

The entire solution aims to ensure that Airbnb can deliver the most relevant and “bookable” rentals to users while continuously optimizing for user experience and business metrics. By systematically following these steps—from initial model design through to scaling, monitoring, and retraining—this pipeline supports a high-traffic site’s mission-critical search ranking functionality.

## Estimate Food Delivery Time

Below is a structured walkthrough of how you might design and implement a system to estimate food delivery time, following the nine-step framework. This example weaves together technical considerations, architectural decisions, and deep dives to demonstrate your mastery of the end-to-end solution.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. PROBLEM FORMULATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The goal: Build a machine-learning model that predicts the total time from order placement to delivery.

• Core Objective: Provide customers with accurate delivery-time estimates.  
• Constraints:  
  – Dynamic environment (traffic, weather).  
  – Changing restaurant workloads.  
  – Potential user/driver location shifts.  

Formula:  
Delivery_Time = Pickup_Time + Point_to_Point_Time + Drop_off_Time  

Motivation for Accuracy:  
– Underestimating leads to unhappy customers waiting longer than promised.  
– Overestimating discourages customers from placing orders.

High-Level Trade-offs to Consider:  
1. Balancing Over- and Under-estimation: Both can negatively affect user experience and retention.  
2. Latency Requirements: Predictions must be computed quickly—ideally within 100ms for each user in real-time.  
3. Frequent Retraining: The model must adapt to changing traffic and market conditions multiple times per day.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. METRICS (OFFLINE AND ONLINE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. Offline Metrics  
• Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):  
  RMSE = √(Σ((predict - y)²) / n)  
  where:  
  – predict = estimated delivery time  
  – y = actual delivery time  
  – n = number of samples  

• Quantile Loss (for confidence intervals):  
  L(y, F(x)) = h_q(y - F(x))  
  This loss function measures how well our model captures different quantiles (e.g., 0.05, 0.95) for probabilistic estimates.

B. Online Metrics  
• Real-time Monitoring of RMSE: Compare predicted times to actual times as they arrive.  
• A/B Testing: Evaluate user satisfaction, changes in order volume, and overall customer engagement/retention.  
• Interval Coverage: For a probabilistic model, track what percentage of deliveries lie within the predicted interval.  

Latency Requirement:  
• Under 200ms (ideally sub-100ms) to produce estimates for each user visit.  

Quality Requirement:  
• Aim to keep the error within 10–15 minutes.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS (MVP LOGIC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Below is a simplified MVP (Minimum Viable Product) outline:

1. Input Layer: The system receives an event whenever a new order is placed or an existing order changes status (e.g., restaurant finished cooking).  
2. Feature Store & Feature Pipeline: Gathers up-to-date features (e.g., current traffic, busy-ness in the restaurant, historical performance, time of day).  
3. Model Service: A real-time prediction service hosting the trained model (e.g., Gradient Boosted Decision Tree or Quantile Regression).  
4. Notification Service: Once a prediction is made, this service sends the new estimate to the user.  
5. Database & Scheduler: Stores historical data and triggers frequent retraining jobs to keep the model fresh.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. DATA COLLECTION AND PREPARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Data Sources:  
• Historical Deliveries (6 months of data): Contains actual total delivery times, store details, user feedback, traffic condition logs, etc.  
• Real-time Updates: Order status changes, driver assignment, and traffic updates.  

Workflow:  
1. Ingestion: Each new event is pushed into Kafka or a similar streaming platform.  
2. Storage for Offline Training: Data is periodically dumped into a data lake (e.g., Amazon S3) in Parquet format for high throughput and efficient querying.  
3. Cleaning & Validation: Remove invalid records, handle missing data (e.g., fill unknown traffic states with average conditions).  
4. Label Creation: The “label” or ground truth is the actual delivery time from the historical data.  

Frequencies:  
• Retraining multiple times daily—ensures the model quickly learns from new data (e.g., large sporting events, new traffic patterns).  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. FEATURE ENGINEERING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Creating robust features is essential for an accurate prediction:

1. Order Features  
   – Subtotal, Cuisine Type, Number of Items, Special Handling Requirements (e.g., large or catering orders).

2. Item Features  
   – Average Item Preparation Time, Food Type Embeddings (if we have a representation of different cuisines or item types).

3. Merchant (Store) Features  
   – Store ID & Store Embeddings (trained or computed from store-level attributes).  
   – Historical Aggregates: Average preparation time (by store, city, time of day), variability in past deliveries.  

4. Time-Based Features  
   – Time of Day (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner rush).  
   – Day of Week / Weekends / Holidays.  

5. Real-Time Contextual Features  
   – Traffic Status: Congestion level, accidents.  
   – Active Driver Count in the area.  
   – Weather Conditions (rain, snow).  

6. Geospatial Features  
   – Distance (latitude/longitude) from restaurant to customer.  
   – Estimated travel time from external map APIs or historical trends.  

7. Derived Aggregations  
   – Rolling Averages: Past X weeks of metrics for store/city/timeOfDay.  
   – Parking Time, typical waiting time for drivers near certain locations.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND OFFLINE EVALUATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. Modeling Approaches  
1. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)  
   – Often yields strong performance, can handle non-linearities.  
   – Loss function may be RMSE or quantile loss.  
   – Easily interpretable feature importances.  

2. Quantile Regression for Confidence Intervals  
   – Predict distribution: For instance (0.05, 0.5, 0.95) quantiles.  
   – Helps the system indicate how uncertain a prediction might be.  
   – Possibly adjust estimates to optimize user retention and satisfaction.  

B. Offline Training Pipeline  
• Data Splits:  
  – Train: last 4–5 months  
  – Validation: next 2 weeks  
  – Test: final 2 weeks (held out)  

• Hyperparameter Tuning:  
  – Evaluate RMSE and quantile coverage on the validation set.  
  – Adjust learning rates, tree depths, l1/l2 regularization.  

• Evaluation Criteria  
  – RMSE: Traditional measure for average error.  
  – Coverage: Evaluate how often actual delivery times fall within predicted intervals for the quantile model.  
  – Balance Over/Under Predictions: Analyze distribution of residuals to ensure we are not biasing the model.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. PREDICTION SERVICE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This service exposes real-time inference:

1. Input & Output  
   – Input: Current order context (restaurant ID, cuisine, traffic, queue length, etc.).  
   – Output: Estimated Delivery Time or (Lower Bound, Mean Estimate, Upper Bound) for a probabilistic approach.  

2. Implementation Detail  
   – Containerize the model (Docker) and deploy with orchestration (Kubernetes).  
   – Use a framework like Flask/FastAPI or model-serving solutions such as TorchServe, TF Serving, or SageMaker.  

3. Low Latency Optimizations  
   – Keep frequently accessed features in an in-memory store or a fast key-value database with single-digit millisecond response times.  
   – Precompute or cache some features if necessary to meet sub-100ms latency.

4. Event-Driven Updates  
   – Whenever an order status changes (e.g., food is ready, driver en route), an event triggers a recalculation.  
   – Updated predictions are then pushed (rather than polled) to the user in real time.

8. ONLINE TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. Testing Strategy  
• A/B Testing: Introduce the new model to a subset of users. Compare engagement, order volume, and post-delivery satisfaction metrics.  
• Canary Release: Gradually increase the percentage of traffic served by the new model to ensure system stability.

B. Continuous Integration and Delivery  
• Automated Build & Testing: Each time the model is retrained, run unit tests, integration tests, and consistency checks on the new model.  
• Model Registry: Store model artifacts and metadata (model version, training date, hyperparameters) to track performance over time.

C. Monitoring Post-Deployment  
• Real-Time RMSE: Compare predicted times to actual times for new orders.  
• Infrastructure Health: Monitor CPU, memory usage, and request throughput on the prediction service.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. SCALING, MONITORING, AND UPDATES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. Scaling the Architecture  
• Horizontal Scaling: Add more model-serving replicas behind a load balancer to handle high request volume.  
• Stream Processing Pipeline (Kafka/Spark/Flink): Ensure that real-time feature computation and notifications can handle spikes in events.

B. Monitoring Infrastructure and Model  
• System Metrics: Latency, throughput, error rates across different services (status service, notification service, estimate service).  
• Model Performance Drift: Track shift in error distribution. If metrics degrade, automatically trigger retraining or revert to a previous stable model.

C. Ongoing Updates and Retraining  
• Dynamic Scheduling: Retrain daily or multiple times per day. The scheduler triggers a data-preparation job, then trains the model, and finally updates the model registry.  
• Iterative Feature Updates: Incorporate new data sources over time (e.g., weather predictions, local events) for continuous improvement.

D. Future Enhancements  
• Personalized Estimates: Incorporate user-level footprints (e.g., user location patterns) to refine predictions.  
• Explainability and Transparency: Provide some rationale or confidence measure along with the predicted waiting time.  
• Expand to Full Probabilistic Approach: Evaluate advanced time-series or Bayesian methods for robust uncertainty estimates.

CONCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

By following these nine steps methodically, you create a robust, low-latency, and continuously improving system that provides accurate food delivery time estimates. This approach highlights a solid foundation:

• Well-defined Problem Objectives  
• Appropriate Offline and Online Metrics  
• Scalable Data Pipelines and Storage  
• Quantile Regression for Interval-based Predictions  
• Real-time Inference and Event-driven Updates  
• Thorough A/B Testing and Continuous Monitoring  
• Rapid Retraining to Adapt to a Dynamic Environment  

Ultimately, this solution balances the trade-offs between over- and underestimation and ensures the system can quickly adapt to real-world changes in traffic, restaurant loads, and driver availability. It positions the platform to maintain a high level of user satisfaction, scalable performance, and trust in the estimated delivery times.
