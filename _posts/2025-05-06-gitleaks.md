description: Process for Checking and Adding Findings to .gitleaksignore

**Objective:**
To ensure that sensitive information is properly managed by first reviewing findings from `gitleaks` and then adding any necessary entries to the `.gitleaksignore` file.
**Steps:**
1. **Run Gitleaks to Check for Findings:**
- Use the `gitleaks` command to scan the repository and generate a report in JSON format:
```bash
gitleaks git . -f json -r findings.json
```
1. **Review the Findings:**
- Open the `findings.json` file to review the detected secrets and sensitive information.
- Use a text editor or a command-line tool like `less` or `cat` to examine the contents:
```bash
less findings.json
```
1. **Identify False Positives or Acceptable Risks:**
- Determine which findings are false positives or acceptable risks that should be ignored in future scans.
1. **Extract Fingerprints of Findings to Ignore:**
- Use the following command to extract fingerprints of the findings you wish to ignore:
```bash
cat findings.json | grep "Fingerprint" | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/"//g' | awk -F':' '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if(i>1) printf "%s%s", (i>2?":":""), $i; print ""}'
```
1. **Add Fingerprints to .gitleaksignore:**
- Append the extracted fingerprints to the `.gitleaksignore` file to prevent them from being flagged in future scans:
```bash
cat findings.json | grep "Fingerprint" | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/"//g' | awk -F':' '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if(i>1) printf "%s%s", (i>2?":":""), $i; print ""}' >> .gitleaksignore
```
1. **Clean Up:**
- Remove the temporary `findings.json` file to keep the workspace tidy:
```bash
rm findings.json
```
**Note:**
Always ensure that the entries added to `.gitleaksignore` are carefully reviewed to avoid ignoring genuine security issues.
