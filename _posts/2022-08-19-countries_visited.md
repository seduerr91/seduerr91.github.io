description: An exciting visual journey through 75 countries. 
---

Countless footsteps across seven continents, numerous sunset views, and countless memories. Through my travels, I've collected a story in each nation and a picture from every single one of them. Every country I've wandered through offered a unique narrative, a chance to walk in an unfamiliar space, and the opportunity to uncover hidden treasures. The world is a book; every country, a chapter. Never let your curiosity cease - there's always a new chapter waiting to be read. The years indicate the first time, I have visted the country. While some stays were short, others lasted years. Some countries, I visited once, some more than ten times.
