"Robust Python" by Patrick Viafore covers various tools and techniques to write more reliable and maintainable Python code. Here's a summary of some of the key tools mentioned in the book:

1. **Type Checking:**
   - **Mypy:** A static type-checking tool that checks type annotations in your Python code, helping to catch type errors before runtime.

2. **Linters:**
   - **Pylint, Flake8, Black:** These are code linters and formatters to ensure code consistency and adherence to style guidelines, improving code readability and reducing bugs.

3. **Testing:**
   - **Unittest, Pytest:** Frameworks for writing and running tests to ensure your code behaves as expected.
   - **Hypothesis:** A property-based testing tool that generates test cases based on specifications, uncovering edge cases you might not think to test.

4. **Code Coverage:**
   - **Coverage.py:** A tool to measure how much of your code is tested, helping identify untested parts of your codebase.

5. **Static Analysis:**
   - **Bandit:** A tool designed to find common security issues in Python code.

6. **Dependency Management:**
   - **Pip-tools, Poetry:** Tools for managing dependencies more effectively, allowing for virtual environments and precise control over package versions.

7. **Build Tools:**
   - **Tox:** A tool to automate testing in multiple environments, ensuring compatibility across different Python versions and dependencies.

These tools are integral in creating robust Python applications by enhancing code quality, maintainability, and reliability.
