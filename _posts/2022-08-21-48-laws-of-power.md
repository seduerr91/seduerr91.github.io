## If you want to be successful, you need to remember a few things. 

First, never outshine your master. It's important to be humble and let your superior take the credit. Second, win through actions never argument. People respect those who take action and get things done. Third, infection: avoid the unhappy. Unhappy people are contagious and will bring you down. Fourth, when asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest. Most people are more likely to help you if they can see how it benefits them. Fifth, use absence to increase respect and honor. If you're not around, people will miss you and appreciate you more. Sixth, think as you like but behave like others. It's important to fit in and conform to social norms. Seventh, play to people's fantasies. People want to escape reality, so give them what they want. Eighth, be royal in your own fashion. Be confident and act like you deserve respect. Ninth, preach the need for change but never reform too much at once. Too much change can be overwhelming and will turn people off. Finally, tenth, make your accomplishments seem effortless. People admire those who make it look easy. eleventh, control the options. If you're in charge,  you can make sure things go your way. And lastly, twelfth, never appear too perfect. People don't trust those who seem perfect, because they seem fake. If you remember these things, you'll be on your way to success.
