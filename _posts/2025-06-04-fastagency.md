# FastAgency: Accelerating Multi-Agent AI Workflows from Prototype to Production

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, orchestrating complex, multi-agent workflows and deploying them to production can be a daunting challenge. **FastAgency** is an open-source framework designed to bridge the gap between rapid prototyping and robust, production-ready deployment for agentic AI systems. Built with flexibility and developer experience in mind, FastAgency provides a unified programming interface, seamless API integration, and powerful deployment toolsâ€”all with minimal code changes.

## What Makes FastAgency Unique?

Unlike traditional agentic frameworks, FastAgency is not just another tool for building agents. Instead, it acts as a **deployment accelerator** for workflows written in frameworks like [AG2 (formerly AutoGen)](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2), allowing you to scale from Jupyter notebook prototypes to distributed, production-grade applications with ease.

### Key Features at a Glance

- **Unified Programming Interface**: Write your workflow logic once and deploy it across both console and web UIs.
- **Seamless API Integration**: Effortlessly connect external APIs to your agents using OpenAPI specifications.
- **CLI for Orchestration**: Manage, run, and debug workflows directly from the terminal.
- **(Planned) Testing Framework**: Automated workflow testing and CI integration for robust deployments.
- **Flexible Deployment**: From local devcontainers to Docker and cloud platforms like Fly.io.

## Quick Start: From Zero to Running Workflow

### Project Setup with Cookiecutter

FastAgency recommends using [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/ag2ai/cookiecutter-fastagency) for project scaffolding. This tool sets up the folder structure, installs dependencies, and even creates a devcontainer for VS Code.

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/ag2ai/cookiecutter-fastagency.git
```

You'll be prompted to select your app type, Python version, and authentication method. Once generated, set your LLM API key (e.g., for OpenAI):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Open the project in VS Code and run the provided tests:

```bash
pytest -s
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see all tests passing.

### Defining a Multi-Agent Workflow

At the heart of FastAgency is the workflow definition. Here's a minimal example of a student-teacher chat workflow:

```python
import os
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig
from fastagency import UI
from fastagency.runtimes.ag2 import Workflow

llm_config = LLMConfig(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    temperature=0.8,
)

wf = Workflow()

@wf.register(name="simple_learning", description="Student and teacher learning chat")
def simple_workflow(ui: UI, params: dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    initial_message = ui.text_input(
        sender="Workflow",
        recipient="User",
        prompt="I can help you learn about mathematics. What subject you would like to explore?",
    )
    with llm_config:
        student_agent = ConversableAgent(
            name="Student_Agent",
            system_message="You are a student willing to learn.",
        )
        teacher_agent = ConversableAgent(
            name="Teacher_Agent",
            system_message="You are a math teacher.",
        )
    response = student_agent.run(
        teacher_agent,
        message=initial_message,
        summary_method="reflection_with_llm",
        max_turns=3,
    )
    return ui.process(response)
```

This code sets up two agents and orchestrates a short learning conversation, demonstrating how easy it is to define agent interactions.

---

## User Interfaces: Console and Web

FastAgency supports multiple UIs for interacting with your workflows:

- **ConsoleUI**: A command-line interface for rapid prototyping and testing.
- **MesopUI**: A web-based interface for interactive, user-friendly experiences.

You can run your MesopUI app locally with:

```bash
gunicorn my_fastagency_app.local.main_mesop:app
```

Then, open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to interact with your agents.

---

## Orchestrating Workflows with the CLI

The FastAgency CLI streamlines development and deployment:

- **Development Mode** (with live reload):

    ```bash
    fastagency dev path/to/app.py
    ```

- **Run a Specific Workflow**:

    ```bash
    fastagency run path/to/app.py --workflow simple_workflow
    ```

- **Set an Initial Message**:

    ```bash
    fastagency run path/to/app.py --initial_message "Hello, let's start!"
    ```

This flexibility allows you to test, debug, and deploy workflows efficiently.

---

## Seamless API Integration

FastAgency makes it trivial to connect external APIs to your agents. By importing OpenAPI specifications, you can auto-generate functions that agents can call, complete with proper security (API keys, OAuth, etc.).

**Dependency Injection** ensures sensitive data (like tokens) is never exposed to the LLM, maintaining security and privacy.

---

## Deployment: From Local to Cloud

- **Build Docker Image**:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build_docker.sh
    ```

- **Run Docker Container**:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/run_docker.sh
    ```

- **Deploy to Fly.io**:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy_to_fly_io.sh
    ```

This makes it easy to go from local development to scalable, cloud-based deployments.

---

## (Planned) Testing and CI Integration

A comprehensive testing framework is in the works, promising:

- Automated workflow testing
- CI pipeline integration
- Mocking of external APIs

This will ensure your multi-agent systems remain robust as they scale.

## Conclusion

FastAgency is purpose-built to accelerate the journey from prototype to production for multi-agent AI workflows. With its unified interface, seamless API integration, and flexible deployment options, it empowers developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.
