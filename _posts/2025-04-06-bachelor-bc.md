Victoria, BC, is a fantastic spot for a bachelor party! It offers great outdoor activities and plenty of fun, all without breaking the bank. Here's a solid itinerary for a mix of adventures, fun, and food for Cameron's weekend celebration:

### **DAY 1: Saturday – Arrive and Explore**
**Morning to Midday: Arrive and Settle In**
- Check into your Airbnb and settle in. Chances are you'll be arriving in the late morning or early afternoon.
- Pack a small bag with your activewear and get ready to explore.

**Afternoon: Cycling the Galloping Goose Trail**
- Rent some bikes and hit up the **Galloping Goose Trail**, one of Victoria's most famous cycling paths. It's a gorgeous multi-use trail that stretches from downtown Victoria out into lush forest and ocean-view landscapes.
- A loop around **Thetis Lake** is especially beautiful and worth considering if you're looking for a shorter ride.
- For rentals, check out **Spinnakers Adventure Centre** or **Victoria Bike Rentals**—prices are reasonable.
- If you're extra keen, you could hit **Lochside Trail** as well, which connects to the Galloping Goose.

**Evening: Casual Dinner + Brewery Hopping**
- Victoria’s craft beer scene is legendary. Start with a wallet-friendly dinner at **Big Wheel Burger** (delicious high-quality burgers) or **Tacofino** for awesome tacos.
- Transition to a brewery hop:
  - **Phillips Brewing & Malting Co.** for excellent beer and laid-back vibes.
  - **Driftwood Brewery** or **Whistle Buoy Brewing** are also worth checking out.

**Night Fun: Bar or Pub**
- Kick off the shenanigans somewhere casual like **Irish Times Pub** (they often have live music).
- If you’re up for something rowdy, hit **The Duke Saloon** for country dancing vibes and good drinks.

### **DAY 2: Sunday – Run, Fun, and Feast**
**Morning: Scenic Morning Run**
- Start the day with a group run along the **Dallas Road waterfront**. This route offers epic ocean views, beaches, and cool breezes. You can even take it all the way to **Beacon Hill Park** and jog through its picturesque gardens.
- If you want an extra challenge, the trails around **Mount Douglas Park** include some hill climbs with incredible city and coastline vistas.

**Brunch: Fuel Up**
- Grab brunch at **Blue Fox Café** or the **Jamaica Me Hungry food truck** (if it’s open) for affordable but hearty eats. You’ll need energy for the day’s activities!

**Afternoon: Outdoor Fun – Kayaking or Axe Throwing**
1. **Option 1: Kayaking or Paddleboarding**  
   Explore **Victoria’s Inner Harbour** or **Oak Bay** by renting kayaks or paddleboards from places like **Ocean River Sports**. It’s a chill way to enjoy the water and see sea life like seals up close.

2. **Option 2: Axe Throwing**  
   If water sports aren’t your thing, try axe throwing at **Axe and Grind**. It’s fun, competitive, and perfect for a group of guys.

**Evening: Group Dinner**
- End the weekend with a low-key but hearty group dinner. Try **Farmhouse Restaurant** or **Bin 4 Burger Lounge** for affordable but delicious options.
- Another great choice is **FishHook**, famous for its fusion Indian-West Coast dishes. Bonus: They’re reasonably priced for local seafood.

**Night: Chill or Comedy**
- If you’re not totally wiped, see if **Hecklers Comedy Club** has a show on Sunday evening (tickets are usually inexpensive). It’s a great way to end the trip with plenty of laughs.

### **DAY 3: Monday – Farewell Breakfast**
**Morning: Final Breakfast Stop**
- Before you leave, grab coffee and breakfast at **Fern Café and Bakery** (Victoria’s vegan favorite) or **Mo:lé** for something hearty and local.

### Other Budget-Friendly Options to Mix In:

- Reserve restaurants or rentals ahead of time for smooth planning with a group your size, especially in April when the city gets busy with tourists.
