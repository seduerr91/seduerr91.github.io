I used to think the ultimate day was filled with lounging and leisure, but I've discovered something extraordinary: a day dedicated to routine, movement, and focus brings me far greater satisfaction. Let me share my perfect day formula – it might just inspire your own.

6:25 AM: Rise, Shine, and Espresso.
I wake with purpose, sharing a freshly brewed espresso with my amazing wife. It's a simple ritual, but it sets the tone for connection and shared energy.

7:00 AM: Gym Time, My Way.
I hit the gym, alternating between high-intensity Peloton cycling and 20 minutes of pickleball drills after, and strength training sessions with my wife. Getting my body moving first thing fuels me for the day ahead.

8:00 AM:  Mind Fuel for the Workday
My day job in the thrilling AI team at Cordial.com keeps my mind buzzing. A power breakfast of smoked salmon, avocado, and egg on gluten-free toast provides lasting energy, plus essential calcium and magnesium.

11:30 AM: Pre-Swim Power-Up
Red Bull and creatine might raise eyebrows, but it's my secret weapon for peak pool performance.

12:00 PM: A Mile in the Water
Nothing beats the pure focus of swimming. I choose one of the pools in our building and push for a full mile – it's my moving meditation.

12:40 PM: Replenish and Get Back to It
I refuel with leftovers from my Blue Apron meal prep, then dive back into work. An hour after swimming, I blend up a strawberry mango smoothie with protein powder for muscle recovery.

4:30 PM: Pickleball Intensity
After a productive block, I head to the Belltown Pickleball courts for hard-hitting, fast-paced matches. It's an incredible outlet for energy and competitive spirit.

6:00 PM: Evenings of Balance
I might work a little more, stay plugged into AI trends, do some Blue Apron cooking, or simply relax with my wife or friends in the jacuzzi. Variety keeps it fresh.

9:30 PM: Winding Down Right
No more alcohol for me – I'm 60 days in after reading 'This Naked Mind'. Chamomile tea and plenty of water help me prepare for deep, restorative sleep.

The Takeaway
This perfect day isn't about indulgence. It's about intentional choices: movement, nourishment, connection, and challenge. It's a balance that allows me to be my best self, every day.
