## Cordial Empowers Marketers with Intuitive Data Analytics

The marketing data landscape is vast and complex, making it difficult for many teams and individuals to extract the insights they truly need. That's where the marriage of Large Language Models (LLMs) and data analytics creates a breakthrough â€“ and Cordial is at the forefront of bringing that power to you. With Cordial, marketers can ask plain-language questions about their data and get actionable results.

By enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to manipulate and probe databases, LLMs are magnifying the reach and utility of data analytics. Furthermore, this approach improves data processing efficiencies and intensifies intelligent database capabilities.

So how does this work? Let's delve into a practical example.

Let's say a user wants to find out, "What was the most popular campaign on Netflix?". In traditional analytics, this query would need to be translated into SQL, a skill not everyone possesses. However, the application of LLMs allows this question in plain English to be efficiently translated into a SQL query:

```sql
SELECT campaign FROM netflix GROUP BY campaign ORDER BY SUM(weekly_views) DESC LIMIT 1
```
This query, when executed, provides the user with a straight-forward answer - `{"campaign":"Netflix Originals Campaign"}`.

## Democratizing Marketing Data

Historically, understanding your marketing data required specialized knowledge of SQL or reliance on technically-skilled analysts. Cordial's LLM integration shifts the paradigm. Marketers at all levels, whether they're a solo email specialist or part of a large omnichannel team, can ask questions like:

- "Which campaign had the highest ROI last quarter?"
- "What are the top 3 characteristics of my highest-spending customers?"
- "Show me where customers usually drop off before their first purchase"
Cordial translates these questions into the appropriate queries, seamlessly interacting with your connected data sources (CRM, ESP, web analytics, etc.).


## Beyond Simple Queries

Cordial's LLM-powered analysis doesn't stop at basic questions. It excels by:

- Proactive Insights: Cordial's machine learning models continuously surface trends and anomalies, suggesting targeted actions like "Segment A is showing decreased engagement, consider a win-back email campaign"
- Visual Explanations: Results are clearly presented, with options to see the query behind the answer and interactive visualizations (built natively in the platform) to aid understanding.
- Guided Journeys: Cordial can build multi-step question flows to dig deeper. A marketer might start with a broad question, and Cordial's UI offers related options to explore, uncovering deeper insights without technical expertise.

## The Cordial Advantage

Cordial's focus on the marketing domain brings several unique benefits:

- Pre-Built Models: Start leveraging LLMs immediately with models tailored to common marketing questions and KPIs, unlike generic query tools.
- Cross-Channel View: Cordial's strength in data unification means your analysis isn't siloed; LLM queries can seamlessly consider email engagement alongside social interaction or website behavior.
- Actionable Results: Insights are directly connected to Cordial's campaign builder. If the system spots a high-potential segment, a targeted campaign can be launched with just a few clicks

## The Future of Marketing Analytics

This is just the start of Cordial's LLM revolution. Imagine future integrations like:

- Natural Language Campaign Setup: "Design a reactivation campaign for customers who haven't purchased in 6 months, focus on promoting our summer sale"
- AI-Generated Content Suggestions: Cordial analyzes a segment and proposes personalized subject lines or offer variations to improve engagement.

The power of LLMs holds immense potential in transforming the landscape of data analytics in marketing. Translating natural language queries into SQL and thus making data analytics a more accessible task is just the dawn of this revolutionary synergy. Therewith, expect the extraordinary evolution of marketing technology where data democratisation and accessibility become inherent components.
