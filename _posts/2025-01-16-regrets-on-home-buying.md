**Starting a New Chapter in Bend, Oregon: How to Find Your Perfect Neighborhood**

*April 1, 2025* marks an exciting new beginning for Seb and Joy as they move from bustling Seattle to the serene landscapes of Bend, Oregon, along with their adorable kittens, Sasha and Simba. This move isn't just about changing locations; it's about embracing a lifestyle that aligns with their passions, values, and aspirations. If you're considering a similar transition, here's how to identify what matters most to you and find a neighborhood that feels like home.

### **1. Reflect on Your Lifestyle and Interests**

Begin by listing your hobbies, work requirements, and what you value in a community. For Seb and Joy:

- **Work:** Both work remotely but prefer coworking spaces to stay connected.
- **Interests:**
  - Seb: Running, trail running, pickleball, community engagement, AI engineering.
  - Joy: Yoga, coffee culture, diverse cuisines, hiking, horseback riding.
- **Transportation:** They own a car but prefer cycling.
- **Expectations:** Better traffic conditions, improved weather, affordability, and a communal atmosphere compared to Seattle.

### **2. Research Bend's Neighborhoods**

Bend offers a variety of neighborhoods, each with its own charm. Here's a closer look at options that might suit Seb and Joy's preferences:

#### **Old Bend**

- **Pros:** Close to downtown, abundant coffee shops, yoga studios, and eateries. Proximity to the Deschutes River Trail is perfect for running and hiking.
- **Cons:** Being a popular area, housing might be slightly pricier, and tourist seasons can bring in crowds.

#### **Westside**

- **Pros:** Known for its vibrant community, access to trails for running and cycling, and pickleball courts. The Westside also hosts several coworking spaces.
- **Cons:** Similar to Old Bend, it can be busy during peak seasons.

#### **Southeast Bend**

- **Pros:** More residential and quieter. Offers horseback riding opportunities at nearby stables and open spaces.
- **Cons:** Slightly farther from the downtown amenities and coworking spaces.

#### **Midtown**

- **Pros:** A balanced mix of residential and commercial areas. Easier cycling routes to various parts of the city. Emerging coffee spots and eateries.
- **Cons:** Still developing, so some amenities might be limited compared to other neighborhoods.

### **3. Visit and Experience**

Before making a decision:

- **Spend Time in Each Area:** Walk or cycle around to get a feel for the neighborhood dynamics.
- **Check Out Local Spots:** Visit coffee shops, yoga studios, running trails, and coworking spaces.
- **Engage with Locals:** Join community events or online forums to ask residents about their experiences.

### **4. Consider Future Needs**

While Seb and Joy are focused on their current interests, it's essential to think ahead:

- **Space for Growth:** If considering family expansion or adopting more pets, ensure the property accommodates that.
- **Work Flexibility:** Check for high-speed internet availability and the proximity of coworking spaces.
- **Resale Value:** Choose a neighborhood with steady property appreciation.

### **5. Budget Wisely**

Avoid common pitfalls by:

- **Setting a Clear Budget:** Factor in all costs, including property taxes, insurance, and potential HOA fees.
- **Prioritizing Needs Over Wants:** Determine must-haves (e.g., proximity to trails) versus nice-to-haves (e.g., extra guest rooms).
- **Exploring Financing Options:** Consult with multiple lenders to find favorable mortgage rates and terms.

### **6. Get a Thorough Home Inspection**

Bend's climate can affect property conditions:

- **Check for Weather-Related Wear:** Ensure the home is well-insulated and check for roofing issues due to snow.
- **Inspect for Maintenance Needs:** Identify any immediate repairs or upgrades to factor into your budget.

### **7. Embrace the Community**

Seb and Joy are eager to meet "normal, fun peeps" in Bend:

- **Join Local Groups:** Participate in running clubs, yoga classes, pickleball leagues, and community events.
- **Volunteer:** Engage with local charities or environmental initiatives to contribute and connect.

### **Conclusion**

Moving to Bend, Oregon, is not just a relocation but an opportunity to align your living environment with your values and passions. By thoroughly researching neighborhoods, anticipating future needs, and immersing yourself in the community, you can make a well-informed decision that minimizes regrets and maximizes satisfaction.

**Final Tip:** Always take your time during this process. Rushing can lead to oversights. Enjoy the journey of finding a place that you and your furry companions, Sasha and Simba, will love calling home.
