# Theory on Extroverted and Introverted Texts

The first researcher on computational textual persuasion is Moon 2002. He asked study participants to rank cars with a computer and the computer would tell them the exactly opposite order. If they’d change then as the computer tells them, then this would measure how much they’ve been persuaded.
Furthermore, Schwartz et al. 2013 identified 75.000 participants on Facebook and their psychological profile and correlated their use of words with the extraversion of the users. This allows to classify short messages of length up to 120 words.
In their article, Zarouali et al. 2020 investigate if people would be more exposed to political micro-targeting if message was consistent with their extraversion. The authors find that, if there is a congruency, then, the intention to act  is 33.8% higher, than in  a non-congruent setup (cf right).
