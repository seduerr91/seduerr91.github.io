Coming out of 2024, I found myself in a state that required a strategic overhaul. Life in Seattle, specifically living at the Onni, had become draining. The combination of traffic, the constant rain, and the gloom of the Wholefoods surroundings weighed heavily on my mood. Professionally, I was spending hours grinding Leetcode, but it felt like empty friction. I wasn't happy. The atmosphere worsened when my amazing colleague Jarret was laid off, dispersing our AI team. Three months later, the axe fell on me too, and I was laid off from Cordial. It was not a good place to be in, but it became the catalyst for necessary change.

### Strategic Decisions and Major Shifts

To turn the tide, I made several decisions that defined the trajectory of 2025. The most significant professional move was joining **Cerebras AI**, a dream job that aligned perfectly with my ambitions.

Simultaneously, I optimized my living environment. I left the density of Seattle for the countryside of **Issaquah**, moving into a townhome with plenty of space. This decision, suggested by Joy, was transformative. With her and our cats, life became cozy and grounded. We also invested in e-bikes to explore the area and I committed to physical resilience by signing up for and training for a 50k race in September.

### Collecting Experiences: A Year of Travel

2025 was also a year of extensive travel, collecting experiences across the globe.

*   **Singapore:** This trip was really cool, reminding me of my internship days in Hong Kong. I loved the food, the cleanliness, the hawker centers, and the vibrant culture.
*   **India:** Attending a wedding here was fascinating. Delhi is impressive, though at times overwhelming. a different standard to get used to.
*   **Indonesia:** While Bali was touristy, it was really fun and brought me back to the "European traveler" life, which I loved. Going to Yogyakarta was a highlight; the Borobudur temples were simply beautiful.
*   **Austin:** A necessary escape for sun exposure. I ran loops around Lady Bird Lake constantly and had a productive time working from a coliving space.
*   **Germany:** It was fun to see my family for my mom's birthday.
*   **US Road Trip (TN/NC/VA):** A road trip with Ravi was incredibly fun. Seeing more of the States made me realize that the Pacific Northwest is actually a really pretty place to live. However, our Pickleball adventures were incredible.
*   **Norway:** Despite the heavy rain, it was breathtaking. Hiking Trolltunga and seeing the Fjords with Arnold was unforgettable.
*   **Scotland:** Aberdeen wasn't my favorite, though the food was great. Edinburgh, however, was fantastic. the city has great energy, and the Harry Potter day trip was exciting.
*   **Ireland:** It is always worth seeing my friend Alex and sharing a Guinness.
*   **Oregon:** Pacing Travis for his 100M race was intense. There was barely any sleep and lots of work, but witnessing the excitement and culture of trail running was really, really fun.

### The Network

No year is navigated alone. Joy was instrumental in the move to Issaquah, making our home life wonderful. Brian was a key partner in helping me run long distances.

Professionally, I was supported by great colleagues like Nam and Pragna, and a great boss, Justin. When the layoff hit, Justin, Chloe, and Jarret were there for me with referrals. Now, at Cerebras, I am grateful to be working with an amazing new team. Sarah, Ryan, Hagay, and Neeraj - are just a few great colleagues to name.

### The Non-Obvious Wins

Beyond the headline achievements, there were subtle shifts that made a difference. Running again with a fixed goal (1000 miles, and the 50k) did more than just improve my fitness; it helped me enjoy life, feel balanced, and healthy. It gave me the motivation and inspiration to apply for jobs with high standards, ensuring I didn't settle for less but worked towards my dream role at Cerebras. It also embedded me into society by joining friends on adventures. I interviewed over 80 times, did 8 full loops and secured 5 job offers.

I also picked up out here **Pickleball**, which surprisingly connected me with people from different age groups who offered interesting and unique perspectives. Additionally, I studied for my first FAA drone exam. It was harder than I anticipated, but I passed on my first attempt, adding a new competency to my skill set.

### Achievements Summary

*   **Ran 2000km**
*   **Obtained a Drone License**
*   **Secured a Dream Job at Cerebras AI**

### The Strategy for 2026

As I look toward the next year, the strategy is clear. I wish for Joy to find more excitement in her work and to excel at horseback riding. For myself, the goals are:

*   **Run 1000 miles**
*   **Obtain a Private Pilot License**
*   **Complete Naturalization**
*   **Remain and excel at Cerebras** (really crush it)
*   **Own a car**

The travel itinerary is already taking shape with desired destinations including New Orleans, Arizona, a Yellowstone road trip, Cabo, and Hawaii.

The philosophy remains: **Work hard, play hard.** I plan to fill the year with trips and adventures with friends:
*   Hiking the Brothers :man-raising-hand:
*   Backpacking the Wonderland Trail :sunny:
*   Hiking around Sahalee Glacier :snowflake:
*   Backpacking parts of the PCT :volcano:
*   Running the Enchantments :snow_capped_mountain:
*   Joining a race or two :dash:

To 2026 - I plan to continue to grow and learn, both professionally and personally. I plan to continue to travel and explore the world, both domestically and internationally. I plan to continue to run and enjoy the outdoors, both hiking and trail running. I plan to continue to learn and grow, both professionally and personally. I plan to continue to be a good friend and family member, both locally and internationally.
