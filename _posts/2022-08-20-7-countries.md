One of my audacious life goals was to live in seven different countries for at least three months each. A strange target by normal standards, you might think! But why not? I yearned for a deeper understanding of varied cultures, something beyond pithy touristic experiences. Diving headfirst into unfamiliar ways of life, befriending locals who see the world from entirely different spectrums - it's a fantastic landscape of experiences that I aimed to traverse.

# Living My Dream: A Journey Across the World

My journey wasn't only about sampling exotic cuisines or snapping Instagrammable shots of scenery, but about imbibing the essence of local life; learning first-hand about differing customs, languages, and ways of life. 

Now with the caveat, as much as I am spellbound by the idea of becoming a globetrotter, I do understand the importance of reigning in one's goals according to life's twists and turns. So the tally of seven is no mandate, but a goal Iâ€™ve striven to achieve. 

So far, my globe-trotting endeavors have taken me through an eclectic range of countries.  

### [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) until 2013

The journey began in the historical nation of Germany. The land of poets and thinkers taught me lessons in resilience and fortitude. I never had to speak any other language rather than German. Hence, until that point, I never did.

### [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary) in 2013 

My next stop was the spellbinding Hungary, where the architectural grandeur of Budapest and the time-frozen charm of rural regions left an indelible mark on me. I lived with two French people. Leslie, who spoke the most perfect British English. Her parents sent her to the UK every summer in her childhood, and Gregoire, who spoke barely any English. Furthermore, I avoided any Germans, incredibly improving both my English and French speaking skills.

### [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) in 2014 

The vibrant city life of Hong Kong was my home in 2014. A mesmerizing blend of eastern tradition and modernity, I was charmed by the bustling markets, neon-lit lanes, and expansive skyscrapers. Working in the 43rd floor, winning the world cup, making amazing friends and traveling 10 countries in 6 months changed my attitude torwards traveling like never before.

### [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria) in 2018

Then it was the timeless allure of Austria. Nestled in the heart of Europe, this country treated me with a dose of classical music, historic architecture, and some of the best Apple strudel I'd ever tasted. Vienna is one of my favorite places in the world, and Blue and Barry my flat mates kittens made it so special. Objectively speaking, it is the most livable place in the world, and having seen a great deal of places, I certainly love to confirm that.

### [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) in 2020

Picturesque landscapes, warm-hearted people, and a culture rich with legends and lore. That's Ireland for you! An unforgettable sojourn wrapped over several trips in 2020. Not my favorite place in the world due to circumstances, but a great place to show around with beautiful nature. I can't wait to bring Joy here.

### [Mauritius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius) in 2021 

The sega rhythms of Mauritius were my most recent backdrop. The idyllic island life and the deeply ingrained multiculturalism of the Mauritian people were truly a remarkable experience. Simply heaven.

### [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) from 2015 to 2022 

Spread across various years, my adventures in the United States have been both diverse and interesting. A cultural melting pot, every state in this vast nation has its unique flavor.

As I continue my journey, I still hold my goal dear to me, and I have cherished each and every step that I have taken thus far. I cannot wait to see where life takes me next! With my Joy.
