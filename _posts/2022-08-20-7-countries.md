# My Global Journey: Living in Seven Different Countries

One of my audacious life goals was to live in seven different countries for at least three months each. A strange target by normal standards, you might think! But why not? I yearned for a deeper understanding of varied cultures, something beyond pithy touristic experiences. Diving headfirst into unfamiliar ways of life, befriending locals who see the world from entirely different spectrums - it's a fantastic landscape of experiences that I aimed to traverse.

And so, my journey began! Yet, I had no intention of inflating this list of countries just to swank a flamboyant record. It was not about the number, but the depth of experiences each destination offered. It was equally important for me to retune my compass towards other valuable priorities when crucial.

Curious to know about my spectacular journey? Here are the splendid countries I graced for more than three months:

This audacious journey of mine, striding across continents, absorbing diverse cultures, and evolving with each experience is a testimony of embracing the unconventional. Life isn't about staying put in one place, but exploring, adapting and growing along the path of your dreams!
