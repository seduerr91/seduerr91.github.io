One of my audacious life goals was to live in seven different countries for at least three months each. A strange target by normal standards, you might think! But why not? I yearned for a deeper understanding of varied cultures, something beyond pithy touristic experiences. Diving headfirst into unfamiliar ways of life, befriending locals who see the world from entirely different spectrums - it's a fantastic landscape of experiences that I aimed to traverse.

# Living My Dream: A Journey Across the World

My journey wasn't only about sampling exotic cuisines or snapping Instagrammable shots of scenery, but about imbibing the essence of local life; learning first-hand about differing customs, languages, and ways of life. 

Now with the caveat, as much as I am spellbound by the idea of becoming a globetrotter, I do understand the importance of reigning in one's goals according to life's twists and turns. So the tally of seven is no mandate, but a goal Iâ€™ve striven to achieve. 

So far, my globe-trotting endeavors have taken me through an eclectic range of countries.  

### [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) in 1991

The journey began in the historical nation of Germany. The land of poets and thinkers taught me lessons in resilience and fortitude.

### [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary) in 2013 

My next stop was the spellbinding Hungary, where the architectural grandeur of Budapest and the time-frozen charm of rural regions left an indelible mark on me.

### [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) in 2014 

The vibrant city life of Hong Kong was my home in 2014. A mesmerizing blend of eastern tradition and modernity, I was charmed by the bustling markets, neon-lit lanes, and expansive skyscrapers.

### [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria) in 2018

Then it was the timeless allure of Austria. Nestled in the heart of Europe, this country treated me with a dose of classical music, historic architecture, and some of the best Apple strudel I'd ever tasted.

### [Mauritius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius) in 2021 

The sega rhythms of Mauritius were my most recent backdrop. The idyllic island life and the deeply ingrained multiculturalism of the Mauritian people were truly a remarkable experience.
