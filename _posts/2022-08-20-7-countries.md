One of my life goals was to live in 7 different countries for more than 3 months each. I believe that this would allow me to dive deeper into the culture and be exposed to locals in a way that would be difficult to do otherwise. Additionally, I think that this would be a great way to learn more about other cultures and to broaden my perspective.

However, I don't want to extend this number as a requirement for my future, as I think it is important to know when you should go for additional priorities.

The countries & dates, I've spend >3 months in:

- Germany in 1991
- Hungary in 2013
- Hong Kong in 2014
- Austria in 2018
- Ireland combined in 2020
- Mauritius in 2021
- United States in 2015-2022
