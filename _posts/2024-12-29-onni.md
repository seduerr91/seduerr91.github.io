**Living at Onni SLU: Is It Worth the Hype for $5K Rent?**

When you make the leap to spend $5K a month on an apartment, expectations are understandably high. You imagine luxury amenities, seamless convenience, and a community designed for comfort. But what happens when reality doesn’t quite match up? Living at Onni SLU in Seattle has been a mixed bag for me, with moments of joy overshadowed by a long list of frustrations. Here's my honest perspective.

### **The Downsides of Living at Onni SLU**

Let’s cut to the chase—there are plenty of things I’ve come to resent about this place. For the price point, you’d think living here would feel like a dream, but unfortunately, that’s not often the case.

#### **1. Everything Costs Extra—Nickel-and-Dimed to Death**
Even for an expensive apartment, it feels like I’m being nickel-and-dimed for every amenity. Want to reserve specific spaces or take advantage of "community perks"? That’s more money out of your pocket. For what I’m already spending on rent, these things should come included, not as add-ons.

#### **2. Dog Issues and the Outdoors**
The area around Onni SLU often smells like pee, thanks to careless pet owners who let their dogs do their business everywhere. There’s no nice green space nearby to decompress, which makes walks outside far less enjoyable. Not to mention the dog messes you constantly have to dodge.

#### **3. Safety Concerns**
Living in South Lake Union should feel vibrant and safe, but my experience has been the opposite. Homelessness in the area is rampant, and it feels unsafe walking around, especially at night. The sound of gunshots and frequent police sirens does nothing to ease these concerns. Safety is foundational for a living environment, and, unfortunately, this area lacks it.

#### **4. Unreliable Elevators and Common Areas**
The elevators are either delayed or simply out of service. On top of that, you lose cell signal while inside, which can be pretty inconvenient. The problem extends to other shared amenities—trash chutes, pools, and the gym are perpetually "under maintenance," making it feel like we're not getting what we paid for. To make matters worse, the pools often feel unclean in the summer, and I’ve heard rumors about people disrespecting them (yes, urine in the pool).

#### **5. Overpriced for What You Get**
The apartments themselves are modern and bright, but they feel impractically designed. Warped airflow makes it hard to heat or cool the bedroom properly, tiny sinks prioritize appearance over function, and the oven takes a whopping 40 minutes to preheat to 375°F. On top of this, the wardrobes are laughably small—just two shelves squeezed together. These details might sound minor, but at $5K a month, I expect better.

#### **6. Poor Maintenance and Helpless Staff**
Things break here far too often. From elevators to basic amenities, it seems like nothing is built to last. Packages consistently go "missing," and finding them feels like solving a mystery. The staff often seems unhelpful or overwhelmed, making it hard to resolve issues when they inevitably arise. Promises like pickleball days - a highlight of the property—have fallen apart, leaving residents like me disappointed.

#### **7. A Social and Noise Problem**
As if the general maintenance issues weren’t bothersome enough, constant parties and loud noise plague the building. Add to that residents who lack basic community manners (like cleaning up after themselves or using the sauna responsibly), and the living experience suffers. If you’re looking for quiet and peace, Onni SLU might not be the best option.

#### **8. The Traffic Nightmare**
South Lake Union is notorious for its traffic, and Onni is no exception. Getting in and out of the area, especially during peak hours, is an exercise in patience. Parking, too, is another headache. And don’t even get me started on the frustration of navigating P6 parking—it’s just plain unacceptable.

#### **9. General Discomfort**
From the steep hill surrounding the building to the noise outside, daily living here feels more inconvenient than comfortable. And with the small apartment size, there’s not much room to create your own peaceful haven. Seattle, as vibrant as it is, often feels overwhelming, grimy, and lacking the cleanliness you might expect for a city pushing this level of rent.

### **What Onni SLU Gets Right**

To be fair, not everything is bad. There are some bright spots that deserve mention.

- **Great Views**: There’s no denying the breathtaking views of Seattle from here. If you love city skylines or waterfront images, you’ll enjoy them daily.
- **Big Balcony**: The balcony is an oasis where I can escape (at least during the moments it’s peaceful).
- **Modern Design**: Despite the impracticalities in some design choices, the apartments are bright and relatively modern. If aesthetics are your focus, you might appreciate this aspect.
- **Soundproof Windows**: While sirens seem to bypass their soundproofing, for the most part, the windows do a decent job of blocking street noise.

### **Final Thoughts: The Verdict on Onni SLU**

Living at Onni SLU has been a frustrating experience. For $5K a month, I expected a seamless and upscale living environment that delivered on its promises. What I got instead was a mix of modern design and great views overshadowed by safety concerns, poor maintenance, crowded amenities, noise, and a lack of practicality.

If you’re considering Onni SLU, weigh these pros and cons carefully. While its bright interiors and stunning views might lure you in, the day-to-day experience of living here could easily make you question what you’re paying for.
