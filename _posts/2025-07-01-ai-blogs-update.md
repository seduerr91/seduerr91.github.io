| [How Exa built a Web Research Multi-Agent System with LangGraph and LangSmith](https://blog.langchain.com/exa/) | LangChain | Exa has launched a deep research agent using LangGraph to process research queries quickly. The system utilizes a multi-agent architecture with a Planner, Tasks, and Observer components. Exa's intentional context engineering allows for dynamic task adjustments based on query complexity. The system balances search snippets and full results to optimize token usage. Observability features in LangSmith are crucial for tracking token usage and informing pricing models. Key takeaways include starting with observability, designing for reusability, prioritizing structured output, and using dynamic task generation. Exa's implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of building agentic systems for real business value. |
