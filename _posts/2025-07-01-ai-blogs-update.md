The recent announcements reflect significant advancements in AI-driven tools and their real-world applications. Key trends include the evolution of agentic systems, as seen with Exa’s deep research agent leveraging LangGraph and LangSmith for scalable, structured, and reusable research solutions. There is also a notable emphasis on enhanced user experiences, demonstrated by the "Moving Archives" project, which uses generative AI (Veo and Gemini) to create interactive and animated museum exhibitions. In the education sector, expanded availability of Google Vids and the introduction of Gemini in Classroom underscore AI’s growing role in making learning more accessible, interactive, and supportive for educators. Across all posts, AI is being deployed to automate complex tasks, enrich content engagement, and democratize advanced technologies for diverse audiences.

| [How Exa built a Web Research Multi-Agent System with LangGraph and LangSmith](https://blog.langchain.com/exa/) | LangChain | Exa, known for their search API, launched a deep research agent that autonomously gathers structured web information. They evolved from a search API to an agentic search API using LangGraph. Their multi-agent system processes research queries efficiently, dynamically generating tasks based on query complexity. The system leverages LangSmith for observability, crucial for cost-effective scaling. Exa prioritizes structured output for API consumption and dynamic task generation for scalability. Their implementation showcases how LangGraph enables sophisticated agentic systems with real business value. Key takeaways include starting with observability, designing for reusability, prioritizing structured output, and using dynamic task generation. This example demonstrates building production-ready systems with LangGraph. |
| [We used Veo to animate archive photography from the Harley-Davidson Museum](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/moving-archives/) | Google AI | The blog post introduces "Moving Archives," a project that aims to animate the historic archives of the Harley-Davidson Museum with the assistance of Veo and Gemini technologies. This initiative promises to bring to life the iconic collections of the museum for a more engaging and interactive experience. |
| [Expanded access to Google Vids and no-cost AI tools in Classroom](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/expanded-access-to-google-vids-and-no-cost-ai-tools-in-classroom/) | Google AI | The blog post highlights expanded access to Google Vids for all education users and introduces Gemini in Classroom, a new suite of no-cost AI tools for educators. This development aims to enhance educational experiences and support teachers in leveraging technology in the classroom. |
