## Prompt for O1

```yaml
Please write a blog article that identifies 10 great places to live for both me and my wife. We work remotely, so we can live anywhere but travel frequently. Each city should have more than 400k inhabitants in the agglomeration. It can be a smaller city like Boulder which is still close to Denver.
I enjoy easy car travel with minimal traffic, safe and clean public transportation, plenty of sunshine, and opportunities for activities like pickleball, running, and trail running. Access to a major airport, proximity to water, and abundant parks are important to me.
I prefer to avoid areas with high levels of homelessness (as it can make me feel unsafe), violence, drug abuse, heavy car traffic, housing shortages, frequent rain, or extreme heat that keeps you indoors for much of the year, insane house prices.

My wife enjoys yoga, workouts, coffee shop culture, and a strong sense of community. In her own words:

> "I love going to live music shows, especially outdoor concerts. I like horseback riding even though I'm not very good at it. My love language is quality time, so my favorite activity is simply going out to eat or having a drink with someone and just talking and enjoying their company. It warms my heart. I don't cook, but I love baking and making desserts. When I'm at home, April and I try to make something new every week. I know I'm a nerd, but I love puzzles. Whenever I live somewhere long enough, I'm working on a puzzle the entire time. Other ways I enjoy spending my time: - anything coffee related - watching documentaries- reading memoirs - being outdoors, especially mountains, I wanna get into backpacking."
Please rate every dimension as low, mid, or high and compile all suggestions into a table where all cities are listed in the same table.
