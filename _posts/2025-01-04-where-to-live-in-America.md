Making the Right Choice

Selecting the perfect city involves balancing your professional needs, personal passions, and financial considerations—including the local tax environment. The top 10 cities above offer a rich blend of outdoor adventures, community engagement, and vibrant cultural scenes. Each destination has its own flavor, from the trail-side ambiance of Boulder and Bend to the energetic music and coffee scenes in Austin, San Diego, and Asheville.

While no city is without its trade-offs, these recommendations highlight locations that enhance your lifestyle—with tax environments that vary from the low state income tax benefits of Texas and Washington (for cities like Austin) to the higher progressive income taxes of California and Oregon. These details serve as one more piece of the puzzle as you embark on an exciting new chapter.

──────────────────────────────
Cities with Higher Levels of Your Disliked Factors (and Their Stories)

For fun, we also take a look at cities where several of your disliked issues are more prominent, interweaving interesting narratives to offer insight beyond bullet points:

1. Los Angeles, California  
Los Angeles is a sprawling metropolis with a cultural magnetism that attracts dreamers from everywhere. However, the city wrestles with significant burdens—from the visually prominent homelessness to heavy car traffic that often turns simple commutes into epic journeys. Add in the high cost of housing, and you have a city that, despite its glamour, challenges your need for both safety and fiscal efficiency. Its tax burden reflects California’s progressive rates, which can push incomes up into the high-tax bracket, especially when paired with soaring property values. LA’s story is one of cinematic paradoxes, where brilliant art meets urban strife.

1. San Francisco, California  
Famed for its tech scene and iconic skyline, San Francisco offers breathtaking views and endless innovation. Yet, this city grapples with pronounced socioeconomic disparities. High levels of homelessness and visible drug use in some neighborhoods cast long shadows over its otherwise vibrant urban tapestry. The cost of living here is astronomical, and the tax burden—a mix of steep income tax rates and hefty housing expenses—only adds to the challenge of calling this city “home.” Even as the fog rolls in each morning, so too do debates about affordability and quality of life.

1. Seattle, Washington  
Seattle may charm visitors with its lush scenery, coffee culture, and technological prowess, but it faces persistent challenges with traffic congestion and heavy rainfall that dims the outdoors much of the year. While the state of Washington does not collect an income tax, Seattle’s overall fiscal health is impacted by high sales taxes and other local fees. The city’s struggles with homelessness and issues of drug abuse create a dichotomy of progress and social challenge, painting a picture of a city in the midst of transformation—sometimes at a taxing cost.

1. Chicago, Illinois  
Chicago’s storied history, culinary delights, and rich cultural heritage stand in stark contrast to the urban challenges found in some of its neighborhoods. Violence and traffic are recurring hurdles, and while the city’s tax system offers a relatively flat income tax rate, the heavy property taxes in some areas burden homeowners significantly. Chicago is a city of extremes—a landscape where soaring skyscrapers meet gritty street realities, and where fiscal challenges often overshadow its robust arts scene and storied past.

1. Houston, Texas  
Houston provides the space and opportunity of a burgeoning metropolis with a lively energy sector and vibrant cultural diversity. Despite the absence of state income tax, many residents find that the benefits are offset by high property taxes and an urban sprawl notorious for heavy traffic congestion. Add to this mix issues related to homelessness and drug abuse in certain districts, and Houston’s economic calculus becomes complex—one that tells a story of opportunity marred by urban growing pains.

──────────────────────────────
Considerations

These cities, both the recommended locations and the worst offenders, may present challenges such as homelessness, drug abuse, traffic congestion, or steep housing costs. Their unique tax burdens—whether it’s Texas’ reliance on property taxes or California’s high income tax rates—play a significant role in shaping the everyday experience. Balancing these factors is a personal journey, and no one city is perfect in every way.

Prompt for O1

Please write a blog article that identifies 10 great places to live for both me and my wife. We work remotely, so we can live anywhere but travel frequently. Each city should have more than 400k inhabitants in the agglomeration. It can be a smaller city like Boulder which is still close to Denver.  
I enjoy easy car travel with minimal traffic, safe and clean public transportation, plenty of sunshine, and opportunities for activities like pickleball, running, and trail running. Access to a major airport, proximity to water, and abundant parks are important to me.  
I prefer to avoid areas with high levels of homelessness (as it can make me feel unsafe), violence, drug abuse, heavy car traffic, housing shortages, frequent rain, or extreme heat that keeps you indoors for much of the year, insane house prices.  

My wife enjoys yoga, workouts, coffee shop culture, and a strong sense of community. In her own words:  

"I love going to live music shows, especially outdoor concerts. I like horseback riding even though I'm not very good at it. My love language is quality time, so my favorite activity is simply going out to eat or having a drink with someone and just talking and enjoying their company. It warms my heart. I don't cook, but I love baking and making desserts. When I'm at home, April and I try to make something new every week. I know I'm a nerd, but I love puzzles. Whenever I live somewhere long enough, I'm working on a puzzle the entire time. Other ways I enjoy spending my time:  
– anything coffee related  
– watching documentaries  
– reading memoirs  
– being outdoors, especially mountains, I wanna get into backpacking."  

Please rate every dimension as low, mid, or high and compile all suggestions into a table where all cities are listed in the same table. Then also take a look at the 7 worst offenders. Make it detailed and lengthy, find interesting narratives and compile unique stories per place and interweave them with the text. We want something to read and not only bullet points. Thanks!

Final Thoughts

Every city carries its own set of trade-offs. While the lifestyle criteria—the ease of commuting, outdoor opportunities, and an active community—are paramount, the fiscal picture, including the local tax burden, is an important part of the decision. From Colorado’s moderate flat tax in Boulder and Colorado Springs to California’s notoriously high tax rates in San Diego and San Francisco, understanding these variables will help you prioritize what matters most for your long-term happiness and financial well-being. 

Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. Embrace this exciting chapter of your life, weigh all factors carefully, and happy exploring!
