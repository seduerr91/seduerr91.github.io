**Embracing Bend: Our Next Great Adventure Begins**

As the snow-capped peaks of the Cascades welcome the first blush of spring, Joy, our two mischievous kittens Sasha and Simba, and I (Seb) pack up the last of our boxes in Seattle. It's April 1, 2025, and while some might think this move is an elaborate April Fool's prank, for us, it's the start of an exciting new chapter in Bend, Oregon.

**Trading Skylines for Mountains**

After years of navigating the bustling streets and overcast skies of Seattle, we yearned for a place that felt more like a community and less like a race. Bend beckoned with its promise of stunning natural beauty, a vibrant yet laid-back culture, and, let's be honest, a cost of living that doesn't make our wallets weep. The fact that traffic here involves more kayaks than cars doesn't hurt either.

**Remote Work, Real Connections**

Both Joy and I work remotely—I'm an AI engineer tinkering with algorithms, while Joy orchestrates projects with the finesse of a seasoned conductor. While we could easily work from home alongside our feline supervisors, we're eager to immerse ourselves in Bend's coworking scene. There's something invigorating about brainstorming amidst the hum of a shared workspace, plus it gives us a reason to actually change out of pajamas. Besides, we're both extroverts at heart, seeking connections beyond pixelated Zoom squares.

**Pedal Power and Open Roads**

One of our goals is to swap four wheels for two whenever possible. We've traded our Seattle commutes of brake lights and honking horns for Bend's cyclist-friendly streets and scenic byways. The city's commitment to cycling is impressive, with miles of bike lanes and trails winding through parks and along the Deschutes River. We're looking forward to pedaling to the local farmer's market on Saturdays, with baskets ready to be filled with fresh produce and perhaps the occasional artisan loaf.

**Nature as Our Playground**

For me, Bend is a runner's paradise. The trails here are legendary, offering everything from gentle riverside paths to challenging mountain terrains. I'll be lacing up my trail running shoes and hitting places like Shevlin Park and the Phil's Trail complex, where the pines whisper encouragement with every stride. And let's not forget about pickleball—apparently, it's a big deal here, and I'm ready to join the local league and serve up some fun.

Joy, on the other hand, is ecstatic about the plethora of yoga studios nestled throughout the city. Whether it's a sunrise session overlooking the river or a cozy candlelit class during Bend's crisp evenings, she'll be there, mat in hand. Her love for horseback riding will take her to the outskirts of town, where ranches offer trails that meander through high desert landscapes, with Mount Bachelor painting the horizon.

**Community and Camaraderie**

One of the things we've already come to appreciate about Bend is its sense of community. Gone are the days of competitive tech chatter at every coffee shop. Here, conversations flow as smoothly as the local craft beer. People are genuine, down-to-earth, and, dare we say, "normal"—in the best possible way. We're excited to engage with neighbors who share a passion for the outdoors, good food, and better company.

Speaking of food, Joy's inner foodie is thrilled to explore Bend's culinary scene. From food trucks serving up global delights to quaint cafes with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air, our taste buds are in for a treat. And with the abundance of local breweries and wineries, date nights are about to get a whole lot more interesting.

**Seasonal Celebrations and Local Treasures**

We can't wait to partake in Bend's quintessential summer activity: the famous float down the Deschutes River. Picture this—lounging on inflatable tubes, sun on our faces, kittens safely at home plotting world domination, as we drift lazily downstream. It's the epitome of Bend life, a tradition we are eager to adopt.

Concerts at the Les Schwab Amphitheater are another highlight. With a backdrop of the river and stars overhead, we'll be swaying to the melodies of both renowned artists and local talents. It's not just about the music; it's about the experience—picnic blankets, impromptu dance parties, and a community that knows how to have a good time.

And then there's Smith Rock State Park. A climber's dream and a hiker's haven, it's one of the Seven Wonders of Oregon. We'll be exploring its dramatic cliffs and winding trails, perhaps even trying our hand at a beginner's climbing route. At the very least, we'll pack a hearty lunch and soak in the views—it beats any skyscraper vista we've seen.

**Weather Worth Celebrating**

Trading Seattle's drizzle for Bend's 300 days of sunshine is a decision we anticipate celebrating every day. The high desert climate means we get to enjoy all four seasons in their full glory. From powdery snow perfect for snowshoeing in the winter to warm, dry summers ideal for evening strolls, the weather here encourages us to be outdoors, nurturing both body and soul.

**Focusing on What Matters**

At the heart of this move is our desire to prioritize the things that truly matter: our health, our relationships, and our family—even if, for now, that family includes two cats who think they're lions. We're eager to build friendships grounded in shared experiences rather than shared industries. Bend offers us the space to slow down and appreciate the nuances of life—the laughter over a campfire, the satisfaction of a long hike, the simple joy of a community event.

**As We Settle In**

Settling into our new home, we're filled with a sense of possibility. Sure, we'll miss some aspects of Seattle (the sheer number of Starbucks on every corner made caffeine fixes incredibly convenient), but the trade-offs are worth it. Less traffic means more time exploring. Fewer skyscrapers mean unobstructed views of the night sky. And a smaller tech presence means conversations can veer away from the latest app update to, say, the best spot to watch the sunset.

So here's to new beginnings in Bend—a place where the pace is just right, the people are authentically themselves, and the adventure is just outside our front door. We're ready to embrace all that this incredible city has to offer, and perhaps, in time, we'll become as much a part of Bend as it is becoming a part of us.

**Looking Forward**

In the coming months, we plan to chronicle our experiences—the highs, the lows, and the in-betweens. We'll share tales of Joy's quest to find the perfect cup of coffee (a never-ending journey), my attempts at mastering the art of pickleball without pulling a hamstring, and Sasha and Simba's inevitable domination of our household.

If you find yourself in Bend, whether passing through or planting roots, drop us a line. Perhaps we'll meet on the trails, at a yoga class, or floating down the river. Until then, here's to embracing change, seeking joy (pun absolutely intended), and living life fully in this beautiful corner of the world.

Cheers,

Seb, Joy, Sasha & Simba
