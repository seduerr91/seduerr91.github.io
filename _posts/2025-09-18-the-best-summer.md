On May 31, 2025, my professional world came to a halt. I was laid off. But what could have been a period of uncertainty turned into the most transformative summer of my life. Instead of letting the setback define me, I decided to redefine myself.

The first order of business was my health. I shed 21 pounds in 80 days, feeling lighter and more energized than I had in years. That newfound energy propelled me into the wild heart of the Pacific Northwest. The mountains were calling, and I plunged headfirst into their embrace, discovering a love for backpacking on a challenging trek to Lake Mason. I stood at the edge of Lake Crescent, the water a brilliant, impossible blue, before taking a soul-cleansing swim. I even made a pilgrimage back to the Snoqualmie 7, the peaks that feel like old friends.

But this summer wasn't just about conquering mountains; it was about broadening my horizons. I hit the open road for a cross-country adventure, weaving through the American South from the music-filled streets of Nashville to the historic charm of Richmond, with a detour to the artsy haven of Asheville. I tested the limits of my endurance, lacing up my shoes to run my first-ever 50k ultra-marathonâ€”a grueling but exhilarating test of will. I addressed my obsession in the fast-paced world of pickleball, battling my way to a 3.98 DUPR rating in a vibrant community of fellow enthusiasts. Professionally, I didn't stand still. I looked to the skies, earning my drone pilot license.

More than anything, this summer was about connection. It was the roar of the crowd at concerts at The Gorge, T-Mobile Park, and the Puyallup State Fair. It was the laughter and shared stories with friends. It was finding a perfect new home with my partner, Joy, and the quiet moments spent cuddling our cats, Simba and Sasha.

Now, with my ski gear prepped for the winter and a heart full of new memories, I feel more recharged and ready for the future than ever before. Sometimes, the unexpected detours are the ones that lead us exactly where we need to be.
