### 42. Trapping Rain Water
#### Problem Description
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on a chart, find two lines, which together with the x-axis forms a container, such that area between them is the maximum.

#### Solution
```python
def trap(height: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Returns the amount of rain water that can be trapped.

    Args:
    height (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers representing the height of each bar.

    Returns:
    int: The amount of rain water that can be trapped.
    """
    if not height:
        return 0

    # Initialize two pointers
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_left, max_right = height[left], height[right]
    result = 0

    while left < right:
        max_left = max(max_left, height[left])
        max_right = max(max_right, height[right])

        if max_left < max_right:
            result += max_left - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            result += max_right - height[right]
            right -= 1

    return result
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of bars.
* Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.

#### Sample Input and Output

```

#### Time and Space Complexity
* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the index.
* Space complexity: O(n), as we store the first n ugly numbers.

#### Sample Input and Output
* Input: `n = 10`
* Output: `12`


### 279. Perfect Squares
#### Problem Description
Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers.

#### Solution
```python
def numSquares(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the least number of perfect square numbers.

    Args:
    n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
    int: The least number of perfect square numbers.
    """
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        j = 1
        while j * j <= i:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1)
            j += 1

    return dp[n]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
* Time complexity: O(n^(3/2)), where n is the input number.
* Space complexity: O(n), as we use a DP array.

#### Sample Input and Output
* Input: `n = 12`
* Output: `3`


### 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
#### Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums`, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

#### Solution
```python
def lengthOfLIS(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    Args:
    nums (list[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The length of the longest increasing subsequence.
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0

    dp = [1] * len(nums)

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
* Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the array.
* Space complexity: O(n), as we use a DP array.

#### Sample Input and Output
* Input: `nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`
* Output: `4`


### 312. Burst Balloons
#### Problem Description
Given an array of integers representing the numbers on the balloons.

#### Solution
```python
def maxCoins(balloons: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Returns the maximum coins.

    Args:
    balloons (list[int]): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The maximum coins.
    """
    balloons = [1] + [x for x in balloons] + [1]

    dp = [[0] * len(balloons) for _ in range(len(balloons))]

    for length in range(2, len(balloons)):
        for left in range(len(balloons) - length):
            right = left + length
            for i in range(left + 1, right):
                dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], balloons[left] * balloons[i] * balloons[right] + dp[left][i] + dp[i][right])

    return dp[0][len(balloons) - 1]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
* Time complexity: O(n^3), where n is the number of balloons.
* Space complexity: O(n^2), as we use a 2D DP array.

#### Sample Input and Output
* Input: `balloons = [3,1,5,8]`
* Output: `167`


### 337. House Robber III
#### Problem Description
The thief has a list of houses.

#### Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        """
        Returns the maximum amount.

        Args:
        root (Optional[TreeNode]): The root of the tree.

        Returns:
        int: The maximum amount.
        """
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0, 0

            left_no_rob, left_rob = dfs(node.left)
            right_no_rob, right_rob = dfs(node.right)

            no_rob = max(left_no_rob, left_rob) + max(right_no_rob, right_rob)
            rob = node.val + left_no_rob + right_no_rob

            return no_rob, rob

        return max(dfs(root))
```

#### Time and Space Complexity
* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
* Space complexity: O(h), as we use a recursion stack.

#### Sample Input and Output
* Input: `root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]`
* Output: `7`
