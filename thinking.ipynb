They weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t skydivers. They were smokejumpers: elite wildland firefighters parachuting in to extinguish a forest fire started by lightning the day before. In a matter of minutes, they would be racing for their lives.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The smokejumpers landed near the top of Mann Gulch late on a scorching August afternoon in 1949. With the fire visible across the gulch, they made their way down the slope toward the Missouri River. Their plan was to dig a line in the soil around the fire to contain it and direct it toward an area where there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much to burn.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After hiking about a quarter mile, the foreman, Wagner Dodge, saw that the fire had leapt across the gulch and was heading straight at them. The flames stretched as high as 30 feet in the air. Soon the fire would be blazing fast enough to cross the length of two football fields in less than a minute.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">By 5:45 p.m. it was clear that even containing the fire was off the table. Realizing it was time to shift gears from fight to flight, Dodge immediately turned the crew around to run back up the slope. The smokejumpers had to bolt up an extremely steep incline, through knee-high <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_2\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"2\"/>grass on rocky terrain. Over the next eight minutes they traveled nearly 500 yards, leaving the top of the ridge less than 200 yards away.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">With safety in sight but the fire swiftly advancing, Dodge did something that baffled his crew. Instead of trying to outrun the fire, he stopped and bent over. He took out a matchbook, started lighting matches, and threw them into the grass. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe thought he must have gone nuts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one later recalled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the fire almost on our back, what the hell is the boss doing lighting another fire in front of us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He thought to himself: <i class=\"calibre5\">That bastard Dodge is trying to burn me to death</i>. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no surprise that the crew didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t follow Dodge when he waved his arms toward his fire and yelled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp! Up this way!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">What the smokejumpers didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize was that Dodge had devised a survival strategy: he was building an escape fire. By burning the grass ahead of him, he cleared the area of fuel for the wildfire to feed on. He then poured water from his canteen onto his handkerchief, covered his mouth with it, and lay facedown in the charred area for the next fifteen minutes. As the wildfire raged directly above him, he survived in the oxygen close to the ground.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Tragically, twelve of the smokejumpers perished. A pocket watch belonging to one of the victims was later found with the hands melted at 5:56 p.m.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Why did only three of the smokejumpers survive? Physical fitness might have been a factor; the other two survivors managed to outrun the fire and reach the crest of the ridge. But Dodge prevailed because of his mental fitness.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<hr class=\"transition\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"x04-space-break-orn\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"h1em-orn\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"../images/1.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\"><span class=\"scap\">When people reflect</span> on what it takes to be mentally fit, the first idea that comes to mind is usually intelligence. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText0\"/>The smarter you are, the more complex the problems you can solve\\xe2\\x80\\x94and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText1\"/>the faster you can solve them. Intelligence is traditionally viewed as <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText2\"/>the ability to think and learn. Yet in a turbulent world, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_3\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"3\"/>Imagine that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just finished taking a multiple-choice test, and you start to second-guess one of your answers. You have some extra time\\xe2\\x80\\x94should you stick with your first instinct or change it?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">About three quarters of students are convinced that revising their answer will <i class=\"calibre5\">hurt</i> their score. Kaplan, the big test-prep company, once warned students to \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText3\"/>exercise great caution if you decide to change an answer. Experience indicates that many students who change answers change to the wrong answer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">With all due respect to the lessons of experience, I prefer the rigor of evidence. When a trio of psychologists conducted a comprehensive review of thirty-three studies, they found that in every one, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText4\"/>the majority of answer revisions were from wrong to right. This phenomenon is known as the first-instinct fallacy.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In one demonstration, psychologists <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText5\"/>counted eraser marks on the exams of more than 1,500 students in Illinois. Only a quarter of the changes were from right to wrong, while half were from wrong to right. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it in my own classroom year after year: my students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 final exams have surprisingly few eraser marks, but <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText6\"/>those who do rethink their first answers rather than staying anchored to them end up improving their scores.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Of course, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible that second answers aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t inherently better; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only better because students are generally so reluctant to switch that they only make changes when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fairly confident. But recent studies point to a different explanation: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so much changing your answer that improves your score as <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText7\"/>considering whether you should change it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just hesitate to rethink our answers. We hesitate at the very idea of rethinking. Take an experiment where hundreds of college students were randomly assigned to learn about the first-instinct fallacy. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText8\"/>The speaker taught them about the value of changing their minds and gave them advice about when it made sense to do so. On their next two tests, they still weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any more likely to revise their answers.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_4\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"4\"/>Part of the problem is cognitive laziness. Some psychologists point out that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText9\"/>we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re mental misers: we often prefer the ease of hanging on to old views over the difficulty of grappling with new ones. Yet there are also deeper forces behind our resistance to rethinking. Questioning ourselves makes the world more unpredictable. It requires us to admit that the facts may have changed, that what was once right may now be wrong. Reconsidering something we believe deeply can threaten our identities, making it feel as if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing a part of ourselves.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Rethinking isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a struggle in every part of our lives. When it comes to our possessions, we update with fervor. We refresh our wardrobes when they go out of style and renovate our kitchens when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no longer in vogue. When it comes to our knowledge and opinions, though, we tend to stick to our guns. Psychologists call this <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText10\"/>seizing and freezing. We favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt, and we let our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We laugh at people who still use Windows 95, yet we still cling to opinions that we formed in 1995. We listen to views that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At some point, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably heard that if you drop a frog in a pot of scalding hot water, it will immediately leap out. But if you drop the frog in lukewarm water and gradually raise the temperature, the frog will die. It lacks the ability to rethink the situation, and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize the threat until it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I did some research on this popular story recently and discovered a wrinkle: it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t true.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Tossed into the scalding pot, the frog will get burned badly and may or may not escape. The frog is actually <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText11\"/>better off in the slow-boiling pot: it will leap out as soon as the water starts to get uncomfortably warm.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the frogs who fail to reevaluate. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s us. Once we hear the story and accept it as true, we rarely bother to question it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<hr class=\"transition\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"x04-space-break-orn\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"h1em-orn\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"../images/1.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\"><span class=\"scap\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_5\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"5\"/>As the Mann Gulch wildfire</span> raced toward them, the smokejumpers had a decision to make. In an ideal world, they would have had enough time to pause, analyze the situation, and evaluate their options. With the fire raging less than 100 yards behind, there was no chance to stop and think. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText12\"/>On a big fire there is no time and no tree under whose shade the boss and the crew can sit and have a Platonic dialogue about a blowup,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scholar and former firefighter Norman Maclean wrote in <i class=\"calibre5\">Young Men and Fire</i>, his award-winning chronicle of the disaster. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Socrates had been foreman on the Mann Gulch fire, he and his crew would have been cremated while they were sitting there considering it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Dodge didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t survive as a result of thinking slower. He made it out alive thanks to his ability to rethink the situation faster. Twelve smokejumpers paid the ultimate price because Dodge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense to them. They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rethink their assumptions in time.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText13\"/>Under acute stress, people typically revert to their automatic, well-learned responses. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evolutionarily adaptive\\xe2\\x80\\x94as long as you find yourself in the same kind of environment in which those reactions were necessary. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a smokejumper, your well-learned response is to put out a fire, not start another one. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fleeing for your life, your well-learned response is to run away from the fire, not toward it. In normal circumstances, those instincts might save your life. Dodge survived Mann Gulch because he swiftly overrode both of those responses.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">No one had taught Dodge to build an escape fire. He hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even heard of the concept; it was pure improvisation. Later, the other two survivors testified under oath that nothing resembling an escape fire was covered in their training. Many experts had spent their entire careers studying wildfires without realizing it was possible to stay alive by burning a hole through the blaze.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When I tell people about Dodge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s escape, they usually marvel at his resourcefulness under pressure. <i class=\"calibre5\">That was genius!</i> Their astonishment quickly melts into dejection as they conclude that this kind of eureka moment is out of reach for mere mortals. <i class=\"calibre5\">I got stumped by my fourth grader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_6\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"6\"/>math homework.</i> Yet most acts of rethinking don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require any special skill or ingenuity.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Moments earlier at Mann Gulch, the smokejumpers missed another opportunity to think again\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that one was right at their fingertips. Just before Dodge started tossing matches into the grass, he ordered his crew to drop their heavy equipment. They had spent the past eight minutes racing uphill while still carrying axes, saws, shovels, and 20-pound packs.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running for your life, it might seem obvious that your first move would be to drop anything that might slow you down. For firefighters, though, tools are essential to doing their jobs. Carrying and taking care of equipment is deeply ingrained in their training and experience. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until Dodge gave his order that most of the smokejumpers set down their tools\\xe2\\x80\\x94and even then, one firefighter hung on to his shovel until a colleague took it out of his hands. If the crew had abandoned their tools sooner, would it have been enough to save them?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never know for certain, but Mann Gulch wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an isolated incident. Between 1990 and 1995 alone, a total of <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText14\"/>twenty-three wildland firefighters perished trying to outrace fires uphill even though dropping their heavy equipment could have made the difference between life and death. In 1994, on <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText15\"/>Storm King Mountain in Colorado, high winds caused a fire to explode across a gulch. Running uphill on rocky ground with safety in view just 200 feet away, fourteen smokejumpers and wildland firefighters\\xe2\\x80\\x94four women, ten men\\xe2\\x80\\x94lost their lives.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Later, investigators calculated that without their tools and backpacks, the crew <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText16\"/>could have moved 15 to 20 percent faster. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText17\"/>Most would have lived had they simply dropped their gear and run for safety,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one expert wrote. Had they \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText18\"/>dropped their packs and tools,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the U.S. Forest Service concurred, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe firefighters would have reached the top of the ridge before the fire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasonable to assume that at first the crew might have been running on autopilot, not even aware that they were still carrying their packs <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_7\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"7\"/>and tools. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout three hundred yards up the hill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one of the Colorado survivors testified, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI then realized I still had my saw over my shoulder!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Even after making the wise decision to ditch the 25-pound chainsaw, he wasted valuable time: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI irrationally started looking for a place to put it down where it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get burned.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. I remember thinking, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m putting down my saw.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One of the victims was found wearing his backpack, still clutching the handle of his chainsaw. Why would so many firefighters cling to a set of tools even though letting go might save their lives?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a firefighter, dropping your tools doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just require you to unlearn habits and disregard instincts. Discarding your equipment means admitting failure and shedding part of your identity. You have to rethink your goal in your job\\xe2\\x80\\x94and your role in life. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFires are not fought with bodies and bare hands, they are fought with tools that are often distinctive trademarks of firefighters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d organizational psychologist Karl Weick explains: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are the firefighter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reason for being deployed in the first place.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. Dropping one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tools creates an existential crisis. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText19\"/>Without my tools, who am I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Wildland fires are relatively rare. Most of our lives don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t depend on split-second decisions that force us to reimagine our tools as a source of danger and a fire as a path to safety. Yet the challenge of rethinking assumptions is surprisingly common\\xe2\\x80\\x94maybe even common to all humans.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We all make the same kind of mistakes as smokejumpers and firefighters, but the consequences are less dire and therefore often go unnoticed. Our ways of thinking become habits that can weigh us down, and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother to question them until it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late. Expecting your squeaky brakes to keep working until they finally fail on the freeway. Believing the stock market will keep going up after analysts warn of an impending real estate bubble. Assuming your marriage is fine despite your partner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increasing emotional distance. Feeling secure in your job even though some of your colleagues have been laid off.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_8\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"8\"/>This book is about the value of rethinking. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about adopting the kind of mental flexibility that saved Wagner Dodge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also about succeeding where he failed: encouraging that same agility in others.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">You may not carry an ax or a shovel, but you do have some cognitive tools that you use regularly. They might be things you know, assumptions you make, or opinions you hold. Some of them aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just part of your job\\xe2\\x80\\x94they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re part of your sense of self.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_8\" src=\"../images/ART_01_ToolsWeClingTo.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Consider a group of students who built what has been called Harvard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first online social network. Before they arrived at college, they had already connected more than an eighth of the entering freshman class <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText20\"/>in an \\xe2\\x80\\x9ce-group.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But once they got to Cambridge, they abandoned the network and shut it down. Five years later Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook on the same campus.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">From time to time, the students who created the original e-group have felt some pangs of regret. I know, because I was one of the cofounders of that group.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be clear: I never would have had the vision for what Facebook became. In hindsight, though, my friends and I clearly missed a series <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_9\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"9\"/>of chances for rethinking the potential of our platform. Our first instinct was to use the e-group to make new friends for ourselves; we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t consider whether it would be of interest to students at other schools or in life beyond school. Our well-learned habit was to use online tools to connect with people far away; once we lived within walking distance on the same campus, we figured we no longer needed the e-group. Although one of the cofounders was studying computer science and another early member had already founded a successful tech startup, we made the flawed assumption that an online social network was a passing hobby, not a huge part of the future of the internet. Since I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to code, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the tools to build something more sophisticated. Launching a company wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t part of my identity anyway: I saw myself as a college freshman, not a budding entrepreneur.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Since then, rethinking has become central to my sense of self. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a psychologist but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a fan of Freud, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a couch in my office, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do therapy. As an organizational psychologist at Wharton, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent the past fifteen years researching and teaching evidence-based management. As an entrepreneur of data and ideas, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been called by organizations like Google, Pixar, the NBA, and the Gates Foundation to help them reexamine how they design meaningful jobs, build creative teams, and shape collaborative cultures. My job is to think again about how we work, lead, and live\\xe2\\x80\\x94and enable others to do the same.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of a more vital time for rethinking. As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded, many leaders around the world were slow to rethink their assumptions\\xe2\\x80\\x94first that the virus wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affect their countries, next that it would be no deadlier than the flu, and then that it could only be transmitted by people with visible symptoms. The cost in human life is still being tallied.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the past year we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all had to put our mental pliability to the test. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been forced to question assumptions that we had long taken for granted: That it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safe to go to the hospital, eat in a restaurant, and hug <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_10\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"10\"/>our parents or grandparents. That live sports will always be on TV and most of us will never have to work remotely or homeschool our kids. That we can get toilet paper and hand sanitizer whenever we need them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the midst of the pandemic, multiple acts of police brutality led many people to rethink their views on racial injustice and their roles in fighting it. The senseless deaths of three Black citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x94George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery\\xe2\\x80\\x94left millions of white people realizing that just as sexism is not only a women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issue, racism is not only an issue for people of color. As waves of protest swept the nation, across the political spectrum, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText21\"/>support for the Black Lives Matter movement climbed nearly as much in the span of two weeks as it had in the previous two years. Many of those who had long been unwilling or unable to acknowledge it quickly came to grips with the harsh reality of systemic racism that still pervades America. Many of those who had long been silent came to reckon with their responsibility to become antiracists and act against prejudice.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Despite these shared experiences, we live in an increasingly divisive time. For some people a single mention of kneeling during the national anthem is enough to end a friendship. For others a single ballot at a voting booth is enough to end a marriage. Calcified ideologies are tearing American culture apart. Even our great governing document, the U.S. Constitution, allows for amendments. What if we were quicker to make amendments to our own mental constitutions?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My aim in this book is to explore how rethinking happens. I sought out the most compelling evidence and some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most skilled rethinkers. The first section focuses on opening our own minds. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out why a forward-thinking entrepreneur got trapped in the past, why a long-shot candidate for public office came to see impostor syndrome as an advantage, how a Nobel Prize\\xe2\\x80\\x93winning scientist embraces the joy of being wrong, how the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best forecasters update their views, and how an Oscar-winning filmmaker has productive fights.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The second section examines how we can encourage other people to <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_11\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"11\"/>think again. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments and a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll discover how a special kind of listening helped a doctor open parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 minds about vaccines, and helped a legislator convince a Ugandan warlord to join her in peace talks. And if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a Yankees fan, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to see if I can convince you to root for the Red Sox.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The third section is about how we can create communities of lifelong learners. In social life, a lab that specializes in difficult conversations will shed light on how we can communicate better about polarizing issues like abortion and climate change. In schools, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out how educators teach kids to think again by treating classrooms like museums, approaching projects like carpenters, and rewriting time-honored textbooks. At work, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explore how to build learning cultures with the first Hispanic woman in space, who took the reins at NASA to prevent accidents after space shuttle <i class=\"calibre5\">Columbia</i> disintegrated. I close by reflecting on the importance of reconsidering our best-laid plans.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lesson that firefighters have learned the hard way. In the heat of the moment, Wagner Dodge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impulse to drop his heavy tools and take shelter in a fire of his own making made the difference between life and death. But his inventiveness wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have even been necessary if not for a deeper, more systemic failure to think again. The greatest tragedy of Mann Gulch is that a dozen smokejumpers died fighting a fire that never needed to be fought.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As early as the 1880s, scientists had begun highlighting the important <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText22\"/>role that wildfires play in the life cycles of forests. Fires remove dead matter, send nutrients into the soil, and clear a path for sunlight. When fires are suppressed, forests are left too dense. The accumulation of brush, dry leaves, and twigs becomes fuel for more explosive wildfires.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Yet it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until 1978 that the U.S. Forest Service put an end to its policy that every fire spotted should be extinguished by 10:00 a.m. the following day. The Mann Gulch wildfire took place in a remote area where human lives were not at risk. The smokejumpers were called in anyway <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_12\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"12\"/>because no one in their community, their organization, or their profession had done enough to question the assumption that wildfires should not be allowed to run their course.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This book is an invitation to let go of knowledge and opinions that are no longer serving you well, and to anchor your sense of self in flexibility rather than consistency. If you can master the art of rethinking, I believe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be better positioned for success at work and happiness in life. Thinking again can help you generate new solutions to old problems and revisit old solutions to new problems. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a path to learning more from the people around you and living with fewer regrets. A hallmark of wisdom is knowing when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to abandon some of your most treasured tools\\xe2\\x80\\x94and some of the most cherished parts of your identity.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

From an early age, it was clear that Mike was something of an electronics wizard. By the time he turned four, he was building his own record player out of Legos and rubber bands. In high school, when his teachers had broken TVs, they called Mike to fix them. In his spare time, he built a computer and designed a better buzzer for high school quiz-bowl teams, which ended up paying for his first year of college. Just months before finishing his electrical engineering degree, Mike did what so many great entrepreneurs of his era would do: he dropped out of college. It was time for this son of immigrants to make his mark on the world.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Mike\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first success came when he patented a device for reading the bar codes on movie film, which was so useful in Hollywood that <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_16\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"16\"/>it won an Emmy and an Oscar for technical achievement. That was small potatoes compared to his next big invention, which made his firm <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText25\"/>the fastest-growing company on the planet. Mike\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flagship device quickly attracted a cult following, with loyal customers ranging from Bill Gates to Christina Aguilera. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literally changed my life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oprah Winfrey gushed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot live without this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When he arrived at the White House, President Obama refused to relinquish his to the Secret Service.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Mike Lazaridis dreamed up the idea for the BlackBerry as a wireless communication device for sending and receiving emails. As of the summer of 2009, it accounted for nearly half of the U.S. smartphone market. By 2014, its market share had plummeted to less than 1 percent.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When a company takes a nosedive like that, we can never pinpoint a single cause of its downfall, so we tend to anthropomorphize it: <i class=\"calibre5\">BlackBerry failed to adapt.</i> Yet adapting to a changing environment isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t something a company does\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something <i class=\"calibre5\">people</i> do in the multitude of decisions they make every day. As the cofounder, president, and co-CEO, Mike was in charge of all the technical and product decisions on the BlackBerry. Although his thinking may have been the spark that ignited the smartphone revolution, his struggles with rethinking ended up sucking the oxygen out of his company and virtually extinguishing his invention. Where did he go wrong?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Most of us take pride in our knowledge and expertise, and in staying true to our beliefs and opinions. That makes sense in a stable world, where we get rewarded for having conviction in our ideas. The problem is that we live in a rapidly changing world, where we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Rethinking is a skill set, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a mindset. We already have many of the mental tools we need. We just have to remember to get them out of the shed and remove the rust.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_17\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"17\" class=\"calibre3\"/>SECOND THOUGHTS</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">With advances in access to information and technology, knowledge isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just increasing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increasing at an increasing rate. In 2011, you consumed about <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText26\"/>five times as much information per day as you would have just a quarter century earlier. As of 1950, it took about fifty years for knowledge in medicine to double. By 1980, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText27\"/>medical knowledge was doubling every seven years, and by 2010, it was doubling in half that time. The accelerating pace of change means that we need to question our beliefs more readily than ever before.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This is not an easy task. As we sit with our beliefs, they tend to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText28\"/>become more extreme <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText29\"/>and more entrenched. <i class=\"calibre5\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still struggling to accept that Pluto may not be a planet.</i> In education, after revelations in history and revolutions in science, it often takes years for a curriculum to be updated and textbooks to be revised. Researchers have recently discovered that we need to rethink widely accepted assumptions about <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText30\"/>such subjects as Cleopatra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roots (her father was Greek, not Egyptian, and her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity is unknown); the appearance of dinosaurs (paleontologists now think some <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText31\"/>tyrannosaurs had colorful feathers on their backs); and what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s required for sight (blind people have actually trained themselves to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText32\"/>sound waves can activate the visual cortex and create representations in the mind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye, much like how echolocation helps bats navigate in the dark).<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"58_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-001-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> Vintage records, classic cars, and antique clocks might be valuable collectibles, but outdated facts are mental fossils that are best abandoned.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_18\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"18\"/>We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re swift to recognize when other people need to think again. We question the judgment of experts whenever we seek out a second opinion on a medical diagnosis. Unfortunately, when it comes to our own knowledge and opinions, we often favor <i class=\"calibre5\">feeling</i> right over <i class=\"calibre5\">being</i> right. In everyday life, we make many diagnoses of our own, ranging from whom we hire to whom we marry. We need to develop the habit of forming our own second opinions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Imagine you have a family friend who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a financial adviser, and he recommends investing in a retirement fund that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in your employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan. You have another friend who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fairly knowledgeable about investing, and he tells you that this fund is risky. What would you do?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When a man named Stephen Greenspan found himself in that situation, he decided to weigh his skeptical friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warning against the data available. His sister had been investing in the fund for several years, and she was pleased with the results. A number of her friends had been, too; although the returns weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t extraordinary, they were consistently in the double digits. The financial adviser was enough of a believer that he had invested his own money in the fund. Armed with that information, Greenspan decided to go forward. He made a bold move, investing nearly a third of his retirement savings in the fund. Before long, he learned that his portfolio had grown by 25 percent.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Then he lost it all overnight when the fund collapsed. It was <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText34\"/>the Ponzi scheme managed by Bernie Madoff.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Two decades ago my colleague Phil Tetlock discovered something peculiar. As we think and talk, we often slip into the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText35\"/>mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians. In each of these modes, we take on a particular identity and use a distinct set of tools. We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasoning: <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText36\"/>we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_19\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"19\"/>and lobby for the approval of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up in preaching that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother to rethink our own views.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Stephen Greenspan and his sister made the choice to invest with Bernie Madoff, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t because they relied on just one of those mental tools. All three modes together contributed to their ill-fated decision. When his sister told him about the money she and her friends had made, she was preaching about the merits of the fund. Her confidence led Greenspan to prosecute the friend who warned him against investing, deeming the friend <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText37\"/>guilty of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknee-jerk cynicism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Greenspan was in politician mode when he let his desire for approval sway him toward a yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94the financial adviser was a family friend whom he liked and wanted to please.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Any of us could have fallen into those traps. Greenspan says that he should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known better, though, because he happens to be an expert on gullibility. When he decided to go ahead with the investment, he had almost finished writing a book on <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText38\"/>why we get duped. Looking back, he wishes he had approached the decision with a different set of tools. He might have analyzed the fund\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategy more systematically instead of simply trusting in the results. He could have sought out more perspectives from credible sources. He would have experimented with investing smaller amounts over a longer period of time before gambling so much of his life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s savings.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That would have put him in the mode of a scientist.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">A DIFFERENT PAIR OF GOGGLES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a scientist by trade, rethinking is fundamental to your profession. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paid to be constantly aware of the limits of your understanding. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re expected to doubt what you know, be curious about what you <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_20\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"20\"/>don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, and update your views based on new data. In the past century alone, the application of scientific principles has led to dramatic progress. Biological scientists discovered penicillin. Rocket scientists sent us to the moon. Computer scientists built the internet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">But being a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText39\"/>scientist is not just a profession. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a frame of mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94a mode of thinking that differs from preaching, prosecuting, and politicking. We move into scientist mode when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. Scientific tools aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reserved for people with white coats and beakers, and using them doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require toiling away for years with a microscope and a petri dish. Hypotheses have as much of a place in our lives as they do in the lab. Experiments can inform our daily decisions. That makes me wonder: is it possible to train people in other fields to think more like scientists, and if so, do they end up making smarter choices?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Recently, a quartet of European researchers decided to find out. They ran a bold experiment with more than a hundred founders of Italian startups in technology, retail, furniture, food, health care, leisure, and machinery. Most of the founders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 businesses had yet to bring in any revenue, making it an ideal setting to investigate how teaching scientific thinking would influence the bottom line.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The entrepreneurs arrived in Milan for a training program in entrepreneurship. Over the course of four months, they learned to create a business strategy, interview customers, build a minimum viable product, and then refine a prototype. What they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know was that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been randomly assigned to either a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscientific thinking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d group or a control group. The training for both groups was identical, except that one was encouraged to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText40\"/>view startups through a scientist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goggles. From that perspective, their strategy is a theory, customer interviews help to develop hypotheses, and their minimum viable product and prototype are experiments to test those hypotheses. Their task is to rigorously measure the results and make decisions based on whether their hypotheses are supported or refuted.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_21\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"21\"/>Over the following year, the startups in the control group averaged under $300 in revenue. The startups in the scientific thinking group averaged over $12,000 in revenue. They brought in revenue more than twice as fast\\xe2\\x80\\x94and attracted customers sooner, too. Why? The entrepreneurs in the control group tended to stay wedded to their original strategies and products. It was too easy to preach the virtues of their past decisions, prosecute the vices of alternative options, and politick by catering to advisers who favored the existing direction. The entrepreneurs who had been taught to think like scientists, in contrast, pivoted more than twice as often. When their hypotheses weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supported, they knew it was time to rethink their business models.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_21\" src=\"../images/ART_02_ScientificThinking.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprising about these results is that we typically celebrate great entrepreneurs and leaders for being strong-minded and clear-sighted. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re supposed to be paragons of conviction: decisive and certain. Yet evidence reveals that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText41\"/>when business executives compete in tournaments to price products, the best strategists are actually slow and unsure. Like <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_22\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"22\"/>careful scientists, they take their time so they have the flexibility to change their minds. <i class=\"calibre5\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m beginning to think decisiveness is overrated\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. but I reserve the right to change my mind.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Just as you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be a professional scientist to reason like one, being a professional scientist doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee that someone will use the tools of their training. Scientists morph into preachers when they present their pet theories as gospel and treat thoughtful critiques as sacrilege. They veer into politician terrain when they allow their views to be swayed by popularity rather than accuracy. They enter prosecutor mode when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hell-bent on debunking and discrediting rather than discovering. After upending physics with his theories of relativity, Einstein opposed the quantum revolution: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText42\"/>To punish me for my contempt of authority, Fate has made me an authority myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sometimes even great scientists need to think more like scientists.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_22\" src=\"../images/ART_03_Preachers.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_23\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"23\"/>Decades before becoming a smartphone pioneer, Mike Lazaridis was recognized as a science prodigy. In middle school, he made the local news for building a solar panel at the science fair and won an award for reading every science book in the public library. If you open his eighth-grade yearbook, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see a cartoon showing Mike as a mad scientist, with bolts of lightning shooting out of his head.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Mike created the BlackBerry, he was thinking like a scientist. Existing devices for wireless email featured a stylus that was too slow or a keyboard that was too small. People had to clunkily forward their work emails to their mobile device in-boxes, and they took forever to download. He started generating hypotheses and sent his team of engineers off to test them. What if people could hold the device in their hands and type with their thumbs rather than their fingers? What if there was a single mailbox synchronized across devices? What if messages could be relayed through a server and appear on the device only after they were decrypted?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As other companies followed BlackBerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead, Mike would take their smartphones apart and study them. Nothing really impressed him until the summer of 2007, when he was stunned by the computing power inside the first iPhone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve put a Mac in this thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. What Mike did next might have been the beginning of the end for the BlackBerry. If the BlackBerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rise was due in large part to his success in scientific thinking as an engineer, its demise was in many ways the result of his failure in rethinking as a CEO.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As the iPhone skyrocketed onto the scene, Mike maintained his belief in the features that had made the BlackBerry a sensation in the past. He was confident that people wanted a wireless device for work emails and calls, not an entire computer in their pocket with apps for home entertainment. As early as 1997, one of his top engineers wanted to add an internet browser, but Mike told him to focus only on email. A decade later, Mike was still certain that a powerful internet browser would drain the battery and strain the bandwidth of wireless networks. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t test the alternative hypotheses.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_24\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"24\"/>By 2008, the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s valuation exceeded $70 billion, but the BlackBerry remained the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sole product, and it still lacked a reliable browser. In 2010, when his colleagues pitched a strategy to feature encrypted text messages, Mike was receptive but expressed concerns that allowing messages to be exchanged on competitors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 devices would render the BlackBerry obsolete. As his reservations gained traction within the firm, the company abandoned instant messaging, missing an opportunity that WhatsApp later seized for upwards of $19 billion. As gifted as Mike was at rethinking the design of electronic devices, he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t willing to rethink the market for his baby. Intelligence was no cure\\xe2\\x80\\x94it might have been more of a curse.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE SMARTER THEY ARE, THE HARDER THEY FAIL</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Mental horsepower doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee mental dexterity. No matter how much brainpower you have, if you lack the motivation to change your mind, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll miss many occasions to think again. Research reveals that the higher you score on an IQ test, the more likely you are to fall for stereotypes, because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText43\"/>faster at recognizing patterns. And recent experiments suggest that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText44\"/>the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">One study investigated whether being a math whiz makes you better at analyzing data. The answer is yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told the data are about something bland, like a treatment for skin rashes. But what if the exact same data are labeled as focusing on an ideological issue that activates strong emotions\\xe2\\x80\\x94like gun laws in the United States?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Being a quant jock makes you more accurate in interpreting the results\\xe2\\x80\\x94as long as they support your beliefs. Yet if the empirical pattern clashes with your ideology, math prowess is no longer an asset; it actually becomes a liability. The better you are at crunching numbers, the more <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_25\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"25\"/>spectacularly you fail at analyzing patterns that contradict your views. If they were liberals, math geniuses did worse than their peers at evaluating evidence that gun bans failed. If they were conservatives, they did worse at assessing evidence that gun bans worked.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In psychology there are at least two biases that drive this pattern. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText45\"/>One is confirmation bias: seeing what we expect to see. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText46\"/>The other is desirability bias: seeing what we want to see. These biases don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just prevent us from applying our intelligence. They can actually contort our intelligence into a weapon against the truth. We find reasons to preach our faith more deeply, prosecute our case more passionately, and ride the tidal wave of our political party. The tragedy is that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re usually unaware of the resulting flaws in our thinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My favorite bias is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText47\"/>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not biased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bias, in which people believe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more objective than others. It turns out that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText48\"/>smart people are more likely to fall into this trap. The brighter you are, the harder it can be to see your own limitations. Being good at thinking can make you worse at rethinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in scientist mode, we refuse to let our ideas become ideologies. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start with answers or solutions; we lead with questions and puzzles. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t preach from intuition; we teach from evidence. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just have healthy skepticism about other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arguments; we dare to disagree with our own arguments.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Thinking like a scientist involves more than just reacting with an open mind. It means <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText49\"/>being <i class=\"calibre5\">actively</i> open-minded. It requires searching for reasons why we might be wrong\\xe2\\x80\\x94not for reasons why we must be right\\xe2\\x80\\x94and revising our views based on what we learn.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That rarely happens in the other mental modes. In preacher mode, changing our minds is a mark of moral weakness; in scientist mode, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sign of intellectual integrity. In prosecutor mode, allowing ourselves to be persuaded is admitting defeat; in scientist mode, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a step toward the truth. In politician mode, we flip-flop in response to carrots and sticks; in scientist mode, we shift in the face of <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText50\"/>sharper logic and stronger data.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_26\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"26\"/>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done my best to write this book in scientist mode.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"59_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-000-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a teacher, not a preacher.

That said, I think most of us would benefit from being more open more of the time, because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in scientist mode that we gain mental agility.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi studied eminent scientists like Linus Pauling and Jonas Salk, he concluded that what differentiated them from their peers was their cognitive flexibility, their willingness \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText51\"/>to move from one extreme to the other as the occasion requires.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The same pattern held for great artists, and in an independent <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText52\"/>study of highly creative architects.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We can even see it in the Oval Office. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText53\"/>Experts assessed American presidents on a long list of personality traits and compared them to rankings by independent historians and political scientists. Only one trait consistently predicted presidential greatness after controlling for factors like years in office, wars, and scandals. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t whether presidents were ambitious or forceful, friendly or Machiavellian; it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t whether they were attractive, witty, poised, or polished.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">What set great presidents apart was their intellectual curiosity and openness. They read widely and were as eager to learn about developments in biology, philosophy, architecture, and music as in domestic and foreign affairs. They were interested in hearing new views and revising their old ones. They saw many of their policies as experiments to run, not points to score. Although they might have been politicians by profession, they often solved problems like scientists.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T STOP UNBELIEVING</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">As I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve studied the process of rethinking, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found that it often unfolds in a cycle. It starts with intellectual humility\\xe2\\x80\\x94knowing what we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. We should all be able to make a long list of areas where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_28\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"28\"/>ignorant. <i class=\"calibre5\">Mine include art, financial markets, fashion, chemistry, food, why British accents turn American in songs, and why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible to tickle yourself</i>. Recognizing our shortcomings opens the door to doubt. As we question our current understanding, we become curious about what information we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re missing. That search leads us to new discoveries, which in turn maintain our humility by reinforcing how much we still have to learn. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know is wisdom.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_28\" src=\"../images/ART_05_RethinkingCycle.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Scientific thinking favors humility over pride, doubt over certainty, curiosity over closure. When we shift out of scientist mode, the rethinking cycle breaks down, giving way to an overconfidence cycle. If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re preaching, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see gaps in our knowledge: we believe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already found the truth. Pride breeds conviction rather than doubt, which makes us prosecutors: we might be laser-focused on changing other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds, but ours is set in stone. That launches us into confirmation bias and desirability bias. We become politicians, ignoring or dismissing whatever doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win the favor of our constituents\\xe2\\x80\\x94our parents, our bosses, or the high school classmates we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still trying to impress. We become so busy putting on a show that the truth gets relegated to a backstage seat, and the resulting validation can make us arrogant. We fall victim <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_29\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"29\"/>to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText54\"/>the fat-cat syndrome, resting on our laurels instead of pressure-testing our beliefs.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the case of the BlackBerry, Mike Lazaridis was trapped in an overconfidence cycle. Taking pride in his successful invention gave him too much conviction. Nowhere was that clearer than in his preference for the keyboard over a touchscreen. It was a BlackBerry virtue he loved to preach\\xe2\\x80\\x94and an Apple vice he was quick to prosecute. As his company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock fell, Mike got caught up in confirmation bias and desirability bias, and fell victim to validation from fans. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText55\"/>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an iconic product,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said of the BlackBerry in 2011. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s used by business, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s used by leaders, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s used by celebrities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d By 2012, the iPhone had captured a quarter of the global smartphone market, but Mike was still resisting the idea of typing on glass. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at a board meeting, pointing at a phone with a touchscreen. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText56\"/>The keyboard is one of the reasons they buy BlackBerrys.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Like a politician who campaigns only to his base, he focused on the keyboard taste of millions of existing users, neglecting the appeal of a touchscreen to billions of potential users. <i class=\"calibre5\">For the record, I still miss the keyboard</i>,<i class=\"calibre5\"> and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m excited that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been licensed for an attempted comeback.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Mike finally started reimagining the screen and software, some of his engineers didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to abandon their past work. The failure to rethink was widespread. In 2011, an anonymous high-level employee inside the firm wrote an open letter to Mike and his co-CEO. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText57\"/>We laughed and said they are trying to put a computer on a phone, that it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the letter read. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are now 3\\xe2\\x80\\x934 years too late.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Our convictions can lock us in prisons of our own making. The solution is not to decelerate our thinking\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to accelerate our rethinking. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText58\"/>what resurrected Apple from the brink of bankruptcy to become the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most valuable company.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The legend of Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s renaissance revolves around the lone genius of Steve Jobs. It was his conviction and clarity of vision, the story goes, that gave birth to the iPhone. The reality is that he was dead-set against the mobile phone category. His employees had the vision for it, and it was <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_30\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"30\"/>their ability to change his mind that really revived Apple. Although Jobs knew how to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthink different,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it was his team that did much of the rethinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_30\" src=\"../images/07_MostAnnoyingThingsPeopleSay.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In 2004, a small group of engineers, designers, and marketers pitched Jobs on turning their hit product, the iPod, into a phone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy the f@*&amp; would we want to do that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jobs snapped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is the dumbest idea I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever heard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The team had recognized that mobile phones were starting to feature the ability to play music, but Jobs was worried about cannibalizing Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thriving iPod business. He hated cell-phone companies and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to design products within the constraints that carriers imposed. When his calls dropped or the software crashed, he would sometimes smash his phone to pieces in frustration. In private meetings and on public stages, he swore over and over that he would never make a phone.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Yet some of Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engineers were already doing research in that area. They worked together to persuade Jobs that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what he <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_31\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"31\"/>didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know and urged him to doubt his convictions. It might be possible, they argued, to build a smartphone that everyone would love using\\xe2\\x80\\x94and to get the carriers to do it Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Research shows that when people are resistant to change, it helps to reinforce what will stay the same. Visions for change are more compelling when they include visions of continuity. Although our strategy might evolve, our identity will endure.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The engineers who worked closely with Jobs understood that this was one of the best ways to convince him. They assured him that they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trying to turn Apple into a phone company. It would remain a computer company\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were just taking their existing products and adding a phone on the side. Apple was already putting twenty thousand songs in your pocket, so why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they put everything else in your pocket, too? They needed to rethink their technology, but they would preserve their DNA. After six months of discussion, Jobs finally became curious enough to give the effort his blessing, and two different teams were off to the races in an experiment to test whether they should add calling capabilities to the iPod or turn the Mac into a miniature tablet that doubled as a phone. Just four years after it launched, the iPhone accounted for half of Apple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The iPhone represented a dramatic leap in rethinking the smartphone. Since its inception, smartphone innovation has been much more incremental, with different sizes and shapes, better cameras, and longer battery life, but few fundamental changes to the purpose or user experience. Looking back, if Mike Lazaridis had been more open to rethinking his pet product, would BlackBerry and Apple have compelled each other to reimagine the smartphone multiple times by now?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The curse of knowledge is that it closes our minds to what we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Good judgment depends on having the skill\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the will\\xe2\\x80\\x94to open our minds. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pretty confident that in life, rethinking is an increasingly important habit. Of course, I might be wrong. If I am, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be quick to think <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_32\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"32\"/>again.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

Over the following month her condition deteriorated. She struggled to locate the glass of water she put next to her bed. She couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find the door to her room. She walked directly into her bed frame.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ursula was a seamstress in her midfifties, and she hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lost her dexterity: she was able to cut different shapes out of paper with scissors. She could easily point to her nose, mouth, arms, and legs, and had no difficulty describing her home and her pets. For an Austrian doctor named Gabriel Anton, she presented a curious case. When Anton put a red ribbon and scissors on the table in front of her, she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t name <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_34\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"34\"/>them, even though \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe confirmed, calmly and faithfully, that she could see the presented objects.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">She was clearly having problems with language production, which she acknowledged, and with spatial orientation. Yet something else was wrong: Ursula could no longer tell the difference between light and dark. When Anton held up an object and asked her to describe it, she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even try to look at it but instead reached out to touch it. Tests showed that her eyesight was severely impaired. Oddly, when Anton asked her about the deficit, she insisted she could see. Eventually, when she lost her vision altogether, she remained completely unaware of it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was now extremely astonishing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Anton wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the patient did not notice her massive and later complete loss of her ability to see\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. she was <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText60\"/>mentally blind to her blindness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It was the late 1800s, and Ursula wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t alone. A decade earlier a neuropathologist in Zurich had reported a case of a man who suffered an accident that left him blind but was unaware of it despite being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintellectually unimpaired.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Although he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blink when a fist was placed in front of his face and couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the food on his plate, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che thought he was in a dark humid hole or cellar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Half a century later, a pair of doctors reported six cases of people who had gone blind but claimed otherwise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText61\"/>One of the most striking features in the behavior of our patients was their inability to learn from their experiences,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctors wrote:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-1p\">As they were not aware of their blindness when they walked about, they bumped into the furniture and walls but did not change their behavior. When confronted with their blindness in a rather pointed fashion, they would either deny any visual difficulty or remark: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is so dark in the room; why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they turn the light on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI forgot my glasses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy vision is not too good, but I can see all right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The patients would not accept any demonstration or assurance which would prove their blindness.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_35\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"35\"/>This phenomenon was first described by <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText62\"/>the Roman philosopher Seneca, who wrote of a woman who was blind but complained that she was simply in a dark room. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now accepted in the medical literature as Anton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s syndrome\\xe2\\x80\\x94<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText63\"/>a deficit of self-awareness in which a person is oblivious to a physical disability but otherwise doing fairly well cognitively. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s known to be caused by damage to the occipital lobe of the brain. Yet I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to believe that even when our brains are functioning normally, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all vulnerable to a version of Anton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s syndrome.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We all have blind spots in our knowledge and opinions. The bad news is that they can leave us blind to our blindness, which gives us false confidence in our judgment and prevents us from rethinking. The good news is that with the right kind of confidence, we can learn to see ourselves more clearly and update our views. In driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s training we were taught to identify our visual blind spots and eliminate them with the help of mirrors and sensors. In life, since our minds don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come equipped with those tools, we need to learn to recognize our cognitive blind spots and revise our thinking accordingly.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">A TALE OF TWO SYNDROMES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">On the first day of December 2015, Halla T\\xc3\\xb3masd\\xc3\\xb3ttir got a call she never expected. The roof of Halla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house had just given way to a thick layer of snow and ice. As she watched water pouring down one of the walls, the friend on the other end of the line asked if Halla had seen the Facebook posts about her. Someone had started a petition for Halla to run for the presidency of Iceland.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Halla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first thought was, <i class=\"calibre5\">Who am</i> I <i class=\"calibre5\">to be president?</i> She had helped start a university and then cofounded an investment firm in 2007. When the 2008 financial crisis rocked the world, Iceland was hit particularly hard; all three of its major private commercial banks defaulted and its currency collapsed. Relative to the size of its economy, the country faced <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_36\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"36\"/>the worst financial meltdown in human history, but Halla demonstrated her leadership skills by guiding her firm successfully through the crisis. Even with that accomplishment, she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel prepared for the presidency. She had no political background; she had never served in government or in any kind of public-sector role.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the first time Halla had felt like an impostor. At the age of eight, her piano teacher had placed her on a fast track and frequently asked her to play in concerts, but she never felt she was worthy of the honor\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so, before every concert, she felt sick. Although the stakes were much higher now, the self-doubt felt familiar. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a massive pit in my stomach, like the piano recital but much bigger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Halla told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst case of adult impostor syndrome I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For months, she struggled with the idea of becoming a candidate. As her friends and family encouraged her to recognize that she had some relevant skills, Halla was still convinced that she lacked the necessary experience and confidence. She tried to persuade other women to run\\xe2\\x80\\x94one of whom ended up ascending to a different office, as the prime minister of Iceland.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Yet the petition didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go away, and Halla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends, family, and colleagues didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop urging her on. Eventually, she found herself asking, <i class=\"calibre5\">Who am I</i> not <i class=\"calibre5\">to serve</i>? She ultimately decided to go for it, but the odds were heavily stacked against her. She was running as an unknown independent candidate in a field of more than twenty contenders. One of her competitors was particularly powerful\\xe2\\x80\\x94and particularly dangerous.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When an economist was asked to name the three people most responsible for Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bankruptcy, she nominated Dav\\xc3\\xad\\xc3\\xb0 Oddsson for all three spots. As Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prime minister from 1991 to 2004, Oddsson put the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s banks in jeopardy by privatizing them. Then, as governor of Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central bank from 2005 to 2009, he allowed the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 balance sheets to balloon to more than ten times the national GDP. When the people protested his mismanagement, Oddsson refused to resign and had to be forced out by Parliament. <i class=\"calibre5\">Time</i> magazine later identified him as one of the twenty-five people to blame for the financial crisis worldwide. Nevertheless, in 2016 <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_37\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"37\"/>Oddsson announced his candidacy for the presidency of Iceland: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText64\"/>My experience and knowledge, which is considerable, could go well with this office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In theory, confidence and competence go hand in hand. In practice, they often diverge. You can see it when people rate their own leadership skills and are also evaluated by their colleagues, supervisors, or subordinates. In a meta-analysis of ninety-five studies involving over a hundred thousand people, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText65\"/>women typically underestimated their leadership skills, while men overestimated their skills.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably met some football fans who are convinced they know more than the coaches on the sidelines. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the armchair quarterback syndrome, where confidence exceeds competence. Even after calling financial plays that destroyed an economy, Dav\\xc3\\xad\\xc3\\xb0 Oddsson still refused to acknowledge that he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t qualified to coach\\xe2\\x80\\x94let alone quarterback. He was blind to his weaknesses.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_37\" src=\"../images/08_Interrupt.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\">Jason Adam Katzenstein/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank; \\xc2\\xa9 Cond\\xc3\\xa9 Nast</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The opposite of armchair quarterback syndrome is impostor syndrome, where <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText66\"/>competence exceeds confidence. Think of the people you <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_38\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"38\"/>know who believe that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deserve their success. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re genuinely unaware of just how intelligent, creative, or charming they are, and no matter how hard you try, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get them to rethink their views. Even after an online petition proved that many others had confidence in her, Halla T\\xc3\\xb3masd\\xc3\\xb3ttir still wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t convinced she was qualified to lead her country. She was blind to her strengths.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Although they had opposite blind spots, being on the extremes of confidence left both candidates reluctant to rethink their plans. The ideal level of confidence probably lies somewhere between being an armchair quarterback and an impostor. How do we find that sweet spot?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE IGNORANCE OF ARROGANCE</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">One of my favorite accolades is a satirical award for research that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as entertaining as it is enlightening. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText67\"/>Ig\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 Nobel Prize, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handed out by actual Nobel laureates. One autumn in college, I raced to the campus theater to watch the ceremony along with over a thousand fellow nerds. The winners included a pair of physicists who created a magnetic field to levitate a live frog, a trio of chemists who discovered that the biochemistry of romantic love has something in common with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a computer scientist who invented PawSense\\xe2\\x80\\x94software that detects cat paws on a keyboard and makes an annoying noise to deter them. <i class=\"calibre5\">Unclear whether it also worked with dogs.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Several of the awards made me laugh, but the honorees who made me think the most were two psychologists, David Dunning and Justin Kruger. They had just published a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodest report\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on skill and confidence that would soon become famous. They found that in many situations, those who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. According to what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when we lack competence that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re most likely to be brimming with overconfidence.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText68\"/>original Dunning-Kruger studies, people who scored the lowest <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_39\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"39\"/>on tests of logical reasoning, grammar, and sense of humor had the most inflated opinions of their skills. On average, they believed they did better than 62 percent of their peers, but in reality outperformed only 12 percent of them. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText69\"/>The less intelligent we are in a particular domain, the more we seem to overestimate our actual intelligence in that domain. In a group of football fans, the one who knows the least is the most likely to be the armchair quarterback, prosecuting the coach for calling the wrong play and preaching about a better playbook.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This tendency matters because it compromises self-awareness, and it trips us up across all kinds of settings. Look what happened <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText70\"/>when economists evaluated the operations and management practices of thousands of companies across a wide range of industries and countries, and compared their assessments with managers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 self-ratings:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_39\" src=\"../images/09_SelfAssessmentsGraph.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\"><i class=\"calibre5\">Sources</i>: World Management Survey; Bloom and Van Reenen 2007; and Maloney 2017b.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In this graph, if self-assessments of performance matched actual performance, every country would be on the dotted line.

To force him out of his post at the central bank, Parliament had to pass an unconventional law: any governor would have to have at least a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in economics. That didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop Oddsson from running for president a few years later.

If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re certain that we know something, we have no reason to look for gaps and flaws in our knowledge\\xe2\\x80\\x94let alone fill or correct them. In one study, the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText77\"/>people who scored the lowest on an emotional intelligence test weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just the most likely to overestimate their skills.

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re driven to deny our weaknesses when we want to see ourselves in a positive light or paint a glowing picture of ourselves to others. A classic case is the crooked politician who claims to crusade against corruption, but is actually motivated by willful blindness or social deception. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText78\"/>Yet motivation is only part of the story.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"62_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3\" id=\"footnote-003-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a less obvious force that clouds our vision of our abilities: a deficit in metacognitive skill, the ability to think about our thinking.

Absolute beginners rarely fall into the Dunning-Kruger trap.

A bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing. In too many domains of our lives, we never gain enough expertise to question our opinions or discover what we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. We have just enough information to feel self-assured about making pronouncements and passing judgment, failing to realize that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve climbed to the top of Mount Stupid without making it over to the other side.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">You can see this phenomenon in one of Dunning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiments that involved people playing the role of doctors in a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText81\"/>simulated zombie apocalypse.

Unfortunately, as they gain experience, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_45\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"45\"/>their confidence climbs faster than their competence, and confidence remains higher than competence from that point on.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w50c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_44\" src=\"../images/12_TotalNovices.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This might be one of the reasons that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText82\"/>patient mortality rates in hospitals seem to spike in July, when new residents take over.

As we gain experience, we lose some of our humility. We take pride in making rapid progress, which promotes a false sense of mastery. That jump-starts an overconfidence cycle, preventing us from doubting what we know and being curious about what we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. We get trapped in a beginner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bubble of flawed assumptions, where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ignorant of our own ignorance.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happened in Iceland to Dav\\xc3\\xad\\xc3\\xb0 Oddsson, whose arrogance was reinforced by cronies and unchecked by critics. He was known to surround himself with \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText83\"/>fiercely loyal henchmen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from school and bridge matches, and to keep a checklist of friends and enemies. Months before the meltdown, Oddsson refused help from England\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central bank. Then, at the height of the crisis, he brashly declared in public that he had no intention of covering the debts of Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s banks. Two years later an independent truth commission appointed by Parliament charged him with gross negligence. Oddsson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s downfall, according to one journalist who chronicled Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial collapse, was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText84\"/>arrogance, his absolute conviction that he knew what was best for the island.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">What he lacked is a crucial nutrient for the mind: humility. The antidote to getting stuck on Mount Stupid is taking a regular dose of it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText85\"/>Arrogance is ignorance plus conviction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d blogger Tim Urban explains. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile humility is a permeable filter that absorbs life experience and converts it into knowledge and wisdom, arrogance is a rubber shield that life experience simply bounces off of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w50c-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_46\" src=\"../images/13_NarcissistTest.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_46\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"46\" class=\"calibre3\"/>WHAT GOLDILOCKS GOT WRONG</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Many people picture confidence as a seesaw. Gain too much confidence, and we tip toward arrogance. Lose too much confidence, and we become meek. This is our fear with humility: that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end up having a low opinion of ourselves. We want to keep the seesaw balanced, so we go into Goldilocks mode and look for the amount of confidence that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just right. Recently, though, I learned that this is the wrong approach.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Humility is often misunderstood. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a matter of having low self-confidence. One of the Latin roots of <i class=\"calibre5\">humility</i> means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom the earth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about being grounded\\xe2\\x80\\x94recognizing that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re flawed and fallible.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Confidence is a measure of how much you believe in yourself. Evidence shows <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText86\"/>that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distinct from how much you believe in your methods. You can be confident in your ability to achieve a goal in the future while maintaining the humility to question whether you have the right tools in the present. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the sweet spot of confidence.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We become blinded by arrogance when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re utterly convinced of our strengths and our strategies. We get paralyzed by doubt when we <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_47\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"47\"/>lack conviction in both. We can be consumed by an inferiority complex when we know the right method but feel uncertain about our ability to execute it. What we want to attain is confident humility: having faith in our capability while appreciating that we may not have the right solution or even be addressing the right problem. That gives us enough doubt to reexamine our old knowledge and enough confidence to pursue new insights.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_47\" src=\"../images/page_45.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText87\"/>Spanx founder Sara Blakely had the idea for footless pantyhose, she believed in her ability to make the idea a reality, but she was full of doubt about her current tools. Her day job was selling fax machines door-to-door, and she was aware that she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anything about fashion, retail, or manufacturing. When she was designing the prototype, she spent a week driving around to hosiery mills to ask them for help. When she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford a law firm to apply for a patent, she read a book on the topic and filled out the application herself.

In one experiment, when students read a short article about the benefits of admitting what we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know rather than being certain about it, their odds of seeking extra help in an area of weakness spiked from 65 to 85 percent. They were also more likely to explore opposing political views to try to learn from the other side.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Confident humility doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just open our minds to rethinking\\xe2\\x80\\x94it improves the quality of our rethinking. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText89\"/>In college and graduate school, students who are willing to revise their beliefs get higher grades than their peers. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText90\"/>In high school, students who admit when they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know something are rated by teachers as learning more effectively and by peers as <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText91\"/>contributing more to their teams. At the end of the academic year, they have significantly higher math grades than their more self-assured peers. Instead of just assuming they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve mastered the material, they quiz themselves to test their understanding.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When adults have the confidence to acknowledge what they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, they pay <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText92\"/>more attention to how strong evidence is and spend <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText93\"/>more time reading material that contradicts their opinions. In rigorous studies of leadership effectiveness across the United States and China, the most productive and innovative teams aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run by leaders who are confident or humble.

To focus on the most promising candidates, the network airing the first televised debate announced that they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feature anyone with less than 2.5 percent of the vote. On the day of the debate, Halla ended up barely squeaking through. Over the following month her popularity skyrocketed. She wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a viable candidate; she was in the final four.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years later, when I invited her to speak to my class, Halla mentioned that the psychological fuel that propelled her meteoric rise was none other than impostor syndrome. Feeling like an impostor is typically viewed as a bad thing, and for good reason\\xe2\\x80\\x94a chronic sense of being unworthy can breed misery, crush motivation, and hold us back from pursuing our ambitions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_50\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"50\"/>From time to time, though, a less crippling sense of doubt waltzes into many of our minds. Some surveys suggest that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText96\"/>more than half the people you know have felt like impostors at some point in their careers. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thought to be especially <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText97\"/>common among women and marginalized groups. Strangely, it also seems to be particularly pronounced among high achievers.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taught students who earned patents before they could drink and became chess masters before they could drive, but these same individuals still wrestle with insecurity and constantly question their abilities. The standard explanation for their accomplishments is that they succeed in spite of their doubts, but what if their success is actually driven in part <i class=\"calibre5\">by</i> those doubts?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">To find out, Basima Tewfik\\xe2\\x80\\x94then a doctoral student at Wharton, now an MIT professor\\xe2\\x80\\x94recruited a group of medical students who were preparing to begin their clinical rotations. She had them interact for more than half an hour with actors who had been trained to play the role of patients presenting symptoms of various diseases. Basima observed how the medical students treated the patients\\xe2\\x80\\x94and also tracked whether they made the right diagnoses.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A week earlier the students had answered a survey about how often they entertained impostor thoughts like <i class=\"calibre5\">I am not as qualified as others think I am</i> and <i class=\"calibre5\">People important to me think I am more capable than I think I am</i>. Those who self-identified as impostors didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do any worse in their diagnoses, and they did significantly better when it came to bedside manner\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were rated as more empathetic, respectful, and professional, as well as more effective in asking questions and sharing information. In another study, Basima found a similar pattern with investment professionals: <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText98\"/>the more often they felt like impostors, the higher their performance reviews from their supervisors four months later.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This evidence is new, and we still have a lot to learn about when impostor syndrome is beneficial versus when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s detrimental. Still, it leaves me wondering if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been misjudging impostor syndrome by seeing it solely as a disorder.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_51\" src=\"../images/ART_16_ArmchairVsImposter.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_51\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"51\"/>When our impostor fears crop up, the usual advice is to ignore them\\xe2\\x80\\x94give ourselves the benefit of the doubt. Instead, we might be better off embracing those fears, because they can give us three benefits of doubt.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The first upside of feeling like an impostor is that it can motivate us to work harder. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably not helpful when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re deciding whether to start a race, but once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stepped up to the starting line, it gives us the drive to keep running to the end so that we can earn our place among the finalists.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"63_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4\" id=\"footnote-002-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> In some of my own research across call centers, military and government teams, and nonprofits, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText99\"/>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found that confidence can <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_52\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"52\"/>make us complacent. If we never worry about letting other people down, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more likely to actually do so. When we feel like impostors, we think <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText100\"/>we have something to prove. Impostors may be the last to jump in, but they may also be the last to bail out.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Second, impostor thoughts can motivate us to work smarter. When we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win, we have nothing to lose by rethinking our strategy. Remember that total beginners don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger effect. Feeling like an impostor puts us in a beginner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mindset, leading us to question assumptions that others have taken for granted.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Third, feeling like an impostor can <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText101\"/>make us better learners. Having some doubts about our knowledge and skills takes us off a pedestal, encouraging us to seek out insights from others. As psychologist Elizabeth Krumrei Mancuso and her colleagues write, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText102\"/>Learning requires the humility to realize one has something to learn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Some evidence on this dynamic comes from a study by another of our former doctoral students at Wharton, Danielle Tussing\\xe2\\x80\\x94now a professor at SUNY Buffalo. Danielle gathered her data in a hospital where the leadership role of charge nurse is rotated between shifts, which means that nurses end up at the helm even if they have doubts about their capabilities. Nurses who felt some hesitations about assuming the mantle were actually more effective leaders, in part because they were more likely to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText103\"/>seek out second opinions from colleagues. They saw themselves on a level playing field, and they knew that much of what they lacked in experience and expertise they could make up by listening. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no clearer case of that than Halla T\\xc3\\xb3masd\\xc3\\xb3ttir.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY HUMILITY</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">When I sat down with Halla, she told me that in the past her doubts had been debilitating. She took them as a sign that she lacked the ability to <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_53\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"53\"/>succeed. Now she had reached a point of confident humility, and she interpreted doubts differently: they were a cue that she needed to improve her tools.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Plenty of evidence suggests that confidence is just as often <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText104\"/>the result of progress as the cause of it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to wait for our confidence to rise to achieve challenging goals. We can build it <i class=\"calibre5\">through</i> achieving challenging goals. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have come to welcome impostor syndrome as a good thing: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fuel to do more, try more,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Halla says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned to use it to my advantage. I actually thrive on the growth that comes from the self-doubt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">While other candidates were content to rely on the usual media coverage, Halla\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uncertainty about her tools made her eager to rethink the way campaigns were run. She worked harder and smarter, staying up late to personally answer social media messages. She held Facebook Live sessions where voters could ask her anything, and learned to use Snapchat to reach young people. Deciding she had nothing to lose, she went where few presidential candidates had gone before: instead of prosecuting her opponents, she ran a positive campaign. <i class=\"calibre5\">How much worse can it get?</i> she thought. It was part of why she resonated so strongly with voters: they were tired of watching candidates smear one another and delighted to see a candidate treat her competitors with respect.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Uncertainty primes us to ask questions and absorb new ideas. It protects us against the Dunning-Kruger effect. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImpostor syndrome always keeps me on my toes and growing because I never think I know it all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Halla reflects, sounding more like a scientist than a politician. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe impostor syndrome is needed for change. Impostors rarely say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is how we do things around here.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is the right way.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I was so eager to learn and grow that I asked everyone for advice on how I could do things differently.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Although she doubted her tools, she had confidence in herself as a learner. She understood that knowledge is best sought from experts, but creativity and wisdom can come from anywhere.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_54\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"54\"/>Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential election came down to Halla, Dav\\xc3\\xad\\xc3\\xb0 Oddsson, and two other men. The three men all enjoyed more media coverage than Halla throughout the campaign, including front-page interviews, which she never received. They also had bigger campaign budgets. Yet on election day, Halla stunned her country\\xe2\\x80\\x94and herself\\xe2\\x80\\x94by winning more than a quarter of the vote.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">She didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t land the presidency; she came in second. Her 28 percent fell shy of the victor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 39 percent. But Halla trounced Dav\\xc3\\xad\\xc3\\xb0 Oddsson, who finished fourth, with less than 14 percent. Based on her trajectory and momentum, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not crazy to imagine that with a few more weeks, she could have won.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Great thinkers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t harbor doubts because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re impostors. They maintain doubts because they know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all partially blind and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re committed to improving their sight. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t boast about how much they know; they marvel at how little they understand. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re aware that each answer raises new questions, and the quest for knowledge is never finished. A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn something from everyone they meet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Arrogance leaves us blind to our weaknesses. Humility is a reflective lens: it helps us see them clearly. Confident humility is a corrective lens: it enables us to overcome those weaknesses.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

Whenever I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wrong, the world makes a little less sense.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-chapter-epigraph-source\">\\xe2\\x80\\x94Dr. Frasier Crane, played by Kelsey Grammer</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"pcalibre x03-co-body-text\">In the fall of 1959, a prominent psychologist welcomed new participants into <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText106\"/>a wildly unethical study. He had handpicked a group of Harvard sophomores to join a series of experiments that would run through the rest of their time in college. The students volunteered to spend a couple of hours a week contributing to knowledge about how personality develops and how psychological problems can be solved. They had no idea that they were actually signing up to have their beliefs attacked.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The researcher, Henry Murray, had originally trained as a physician and biochemist. After becoming a distinguished psychologist, he was disillusioned that his field paid little attention to how people navigate difficult interactions, so he decided to create them in his own lab. He gave students a month to write out their personal philosophy of <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_56\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"56\"/>life, including their core values and guiding principles. When they showed up to submit their work, they were paired with another student who had done the same exercise. They would have a day or two to read each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s philosophies, and then they would be filmed debating them. The experience would be much more intense than they anticipated.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Murray modeled the study on psychological assessments he had developed for spies in World War II. As a lieutenant colonel, Murray had been recruited to vet potential agents for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. To gauge how candidates would handle pressure, he sent them down to a basement to be interrogated with a bright light shining in their faces. The examiner would wait for an inconsistency in their accounts to pop up and then scream, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a liar!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some candidates quit on the spot; others were reduced to tears. Those who withstood the onslaught got the gig.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Now Murray was ready for a more systematic study of reactions to stress. He had carefully screened students to create a sample that included a wide range of personalities and mental health profiles. He gave them code names based on their character traits, including Drill, Quartz, Locust, Hinge, and Lawful\\xe2\\x80\\x94more on him later.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When students arrived for the debate, they discovered that their sparring partner was not a peer but a law student. What they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know was that the law student was in cahoots with the research team: his task was to spend eighteen minutes launching an aggressive assault on their worldviews. Murray called it a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstressful interpersonal disputation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d having directed the law student to make the participants angry and anxious with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmode of attack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvehement, sweeping, and personally abusive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The poor students sweated and shouted as they struggled to defend their ideals.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The pain didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop there. In the weeks that followed, the students were invited back to the lab to discuss the films of their own interactions. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_57\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"57\"/>They watched themselves grimacing and stringing together incoherent sentences. All in all, they spent about eight hours reliving those humiliating eighteen minutes. A quarter century later, when the participants reflected on the experience, it was clear that many had found it agonizing. Drill described feeling \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunabating rage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Locust recalled his bewilderment, anger, chagrin, and discomfort. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey have deceived me, telling me there was going to be a discussion, when in fact there was an attack,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow could they have done this to me; what is the point of this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Other participants had a strikingly different response: they actually seemed to get a kick out of being forced to rethink their beliefs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText107\"/>Some may have found the experience mildly discomforting, in that their cherished (and in my case, at least, sophomoric) philosophies were challenged in an aggressive manner,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one participant remembers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it was hardly an experience that would blight one for a week, let alone a life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Another described the whole series of <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText108\"/>events as \\xe2\\x80\\x9chighly agreeable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A third went so far as to call it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ever since I first read about the participants who reacted enthusiastically, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been fascinated by what made them tick. How did they manage to enjoy the experience of having their beliefs eviscerated\\xe2\\x80\\x94and how can the rest of us learn to do the same?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Since the records of the study are still sealed and the vast majority of the participants haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t revealed their identities, I did the next best thing: I went searching for people like them. I found a Nobel Prize\\xe2\\x80\\x93winning scientist and two of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top election forecasters. They aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just comfortable being wrong; they actually seem to be thrilled by it. I think they can teach us something about how to be more graceful and accepting in moments when we discover that our beliefs might not be true. The goal is not to be wrong more often. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to recognize that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all wrong more often than we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to admit, and the more we deny it, the deeper the hole we dig for ourselves.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_58\" src=\"../images/ART_17_HowToAcquireWisdom-revised.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_58\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"58\" class=\"calibre3\"/>THE DICTATOR POLICING YOUR THOUGHTS</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">When our son was five, he was excited to learn that his uncle was expecting a child. My wife and I both predicted a boy, and so did our son. A few weeks later, we found out the baby would be a girl. When we broke the news to our son, he burst into tears. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy are you crying?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it because you were hoping your new cousin would be a boy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted, pounding his fists on the floor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause we were wrong!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I explained that being wrong isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always a bad thing. It can be a sign that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned something new\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that discovery itself can be a delight.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This realization didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come naturally to me. Growing up, I was determined to be right. In second grade I corrected my teacher for <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_59\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"59\"/>misspelling the word <i class=\"calibre5\">lightning</i> as <i class=\"calibre5\">lightening</i>. When trading baseball cards I would rattle off statistics from recent games as proof that the price guide was valuing players inaccurately. My friends found this annoying and started calling me Mr. Facts. It got so bad that one day my best friend announced that he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk to me until I admitted I was wrong. It was the beginning of my journey to become more accepting of my own fallibility.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In a classic paper, sociologist Murray Davis argued that when ideas survive, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re true\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re interesting. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText109\"/>What makes an idea interesting is that it challenges our weakly held opinions. Did you know that the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText110\"/>moon might originally have formed inside a vaporous Earth out of magma rain? That a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText111\"/>narwhal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tusk is actually a tooth? When an idea or assumption doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter deeply to us, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re often excited to question it. The natural sequence of emotions is surprise (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReally?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) followed by curiosity (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me more!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and thrill (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhoa!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). To paraphrase a line attributed to Isaac Asimov, great discoveries often begin not with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEureka!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When a core belief is questioned, though, we tend to shut down rather than open up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText112\"/>miniature dictator living inside our heads, controlling the flow of facts to our minds, much like Kim Jong-un controls the press in North Korea. The technical term for this in psychology is the totalitarian ego, and its job is to keep out threatening information.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to see how an inner dictator comes in handy when someone attacks our character or intelligence. Those kinds of personal affronts threaten to shatter aspects of our identities that are important to us and might be difficult to change. The totalitarian ego steps in like a bodyguard for our minds, protecting our self-image by feeding us comforting lies. <i class=\"calibre5\">They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all just jealous. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really, really, ridiculously good-looking. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the verge of inventing the next Pet Rock.</i> As physicist Richard Feynman quipped, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText113\"/>You must not fool yourself\\xe2\\x80\\x94and you are the easiest person to fool.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Our inner dictator also likes to take charge when our deeply held <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_60\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"60\"/>opinions are threatened. In the Harvard study of attacking students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worldviews, the participant who had the strongest negative reaction was code-named Lawful. He came from a blue-collar background and was unusually precocious, having started college at sixteen and joined the study at seventeen. One of his beliefs was that technology was harming civilization, and he became hostile when his views were questioned. Lawful went on to become an academic, and when he penned his magnum opus, it was clear that he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed his mind. His concerns about technology had only intensified:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-1p\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText114\"/>The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadvanced\\xe2\\x80\\x9d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. to physical suffering as well\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That kind of conviction is a common response to threats. Neuroscientists find that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText115\"/>when our core beliefs are challenged, it can <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText116\"/>trigger the amygdala, the primitive \\xe2\\x80\\x9clizard brain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that breezes right past cool rationality and activates a hot fight-or-flight response. The anger and fear are visceral: it feels as if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been punched in the mind. The totalitarian ego comes to the rescue with mental armor. We become preachers or prosecutors striving to convert or condemn the unenlightened. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText117\"/>Presented with someone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re quite adept at spotting the weaknesses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d journalist Elizabeth Kolbert writes, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe positions we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re blind about are our own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I find this odd, because we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t born with our opinions. Unlike our height or raw intelligence, we have full control over what we believe is true. We choose our views, and we can choose to rethink them any time we want. This should be a familiar task, because we have a lifetime of evidence that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wrong on a regular basis. <i class=\"calibre5\">I was sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d finish a draft <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_61\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"61\"/>of this chapter by Friday. I was certain the cereal with the toucan on the box was Fruit Loops, but I just noticed the box says Froot Loops. I was sure I put the milk back in the fridge last night, but strangely it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sitting on the counter this morning.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The inner dictator manages to prevail by activating an overconfidence cycle. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText118\"/>First, our wrong opinions are shielded in filter bubbles, where we feel pride when we see only information that supports our convictions. Then our beliefs are sealed in echo chambers, where we hear only from people who intensify and validate them. Although the resulting fortress can appear impenetrable, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a growing community of experts who are determined to break through.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">ATTACHMENT ISSUES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Not long ago <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText119\"/>I gave a speech at a conference about my research on givers, takers, and matchers. I was studying whether generous, selfish, or fair people were more productive in jobs like sales and engineering. One of the attendees was Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize\\xe2\\x80\\x93winning psychologist who has spent much of his career demonstrating how flawed our intuitions are. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText120\"/>He told me afterward that he was surprised by my finding that givers had higher rates of failure than takers and matchers\\xe2\\x80\\x94but higher rates of success, too.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When you read a study that surprises you, how do you react? Many people would get defensive, searching for flaws in the study\\xe2\\x80\\x99s design or the statistical analysis. Danny did the opposite. His eyes lit up, and a huge grin appeared on his face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was wonderful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Later, I sat down with Danny for lunch and asked him about his reaction. It looked a lot to me like the joy of being wrong\\xe2\\x80\\x94his eyes twinkled as if he was having fun. He said that in his eighty-five years, no one had pointed that out before, but yes, he genuinely enjoys discovering that he was wrong, because it means he is now less wrong than before.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_62\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"62\"/>I knew the feeling. In college, what first attracted me to social science was reading studies that clashed with my expectations; I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to tell my roommates about all the assumptions I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been rethinking. In my first independent research project, I tested some predictions of my own, and more than a dozen of my hypotheses turned out to be false.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"64_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-008-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> It was a major lesson in intellectual humility, but I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t devastated. I felt an immediate rush of excitement. Discovering I was wrong felt joyful because it meant I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d learned something. As Danny told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeing wrong is the only way I feel sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Danny isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interested in preaching, prosecuting, or politicking. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a scientist devoted to the truth. When I asked him how he stays in that mode, he said he refuses to let his beliefs become part of his identity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI change my mind at a speed that drives my collaborators crazy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy attachment to my ideas is provisional. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no unconditional love for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Attachment. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what keeps us from recognizing when our opinions are off the mark and rethinking them. To unlock the joy of being wrong, we need to detach. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that two kinds of detachment are especially useful: detaching your present from your past and detaching your opinions from your identity.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start with detaching your present from your past. In psychology, one way of measuring the similarity between the person you are right now and your former self is to ask: which pair of circles best describes how you see yourself?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_63\" src=\"../images/ART_18_PastPresentMe.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_63\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"63\"/>In the moment, separating your past self from your current self can be unsettling. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText121\"/>Even positive changes can lead to negative emotions; <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText122\"/>evolving your identity can leave you feeling derailed and disconnected. Over time, though, rethinking who you are appears to become mentally healthy\\xe2\\x80\\x94as long as <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText123\"/>you can tell a coherent story about how you got from past to present you. In one study, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText124\"/>when people felt detached from their past selves, they became less depressed over the course of the year. When you feel as if your life is changing direction, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the process of shifting who you are, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easier to walk away from foolish beliefs you once held.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My past self was Mr. Facts\\xe2\\x80\\x94I was too fixated on knowing. Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m more interested in finding out what I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. As Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText125\"/>If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look back at yourself and think, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Wow, how stupid I was a year ago,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then you must not have learned much in the last year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The second kind of detachment is separating your opinions from your identity. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m guessing you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to see a doctor whose identity is Professional Lobotomist, send your kids to a teacher whose identity is Corporal Punisher, or live in a town where the police chief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity is Stop-and-Frisker. Once upon a time, all of these practices were seen as reasonable and effective.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Most of us are accustomed to defining ourselves in terms of our beliefs, ideas, and ideologies. This can become a problem when it prevents us from changing our minds as the world changes and knowledge evolves. Our opinions can become so sacred that we grow hostile to the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_64\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"64\"/>mere thought of being wrong, and the totalitarian ego leaps in to silence counterarguments, squash contrary evidence, and close the door on learning.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Who you are should be a question of what you value, not what you believe. Values are your core principles in life\\xe2\\x80\\x94they might be excellence and generosity, freedom and fairness, or security and integrity. Basing your identity on these kinds of principles enables you to remain open-minded about the best ways to advance them. You want the doctor whose identity is protecting health, the teacher whose identity is helping students learn, and the police chief whose identity is promoting safety and justice. When they define themselves by values rather than opinions, they buy themselves the flexibility to update their practices in light of new evidence.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_64\" src=\"../images/page_62.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_65\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"65\" class=\"calibre3\"/>THE YODA EFFECT: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYOU MUST UNLEARN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">On my quest to find people who enjoy discovering they were wrong, a trusted colleague told me I had to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText126\"/>meet Jean-Pierre Beugoms. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in his late forties, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the sort of person who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s honest to a fault; he tells the truth even if it hurts. When his son was a toddler, they were watching a space documentary together, and Jean-Pierre casually mentioned that the sun would one day turn into a red giant and engulf the Earth. His son was not amused. Between tears, he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I <i class=\"calibre5\">love</i> this planet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jean-Pierre felt so terrible that he decided to bite his tongue instead of mentioning threats that could prevent the Earth from even lasting that long.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Back in the 1990s, Jean-Pierre had a hobby of collecting the predictions that pundits made on the news and scoring his own forecasts against them. Eventually he started competing in forecasting tournaments\\xe2\\x80\\x94international contests hosted by Good Judgment, where people try to predict the future. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a daunting task; there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an old saying that historians can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even predict the past. A typical tournament draws thousands of entrants from around the world to anticipate big political, economic, and technological events. The questions are time-bound, with measurable, specific results. Will the current president of Iran still be in office in six months? Which soccer team will win the next World Cup? In the following year, will an individual or a company face criminal charges for an accident involving a self-driving vehicle?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Participants don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just answer yes or no; they have to give their odds. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a systematic way of testing whether they know what they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. They get scored months later on accuracy and calibration\\xe2\\x80\\x94earning points not just for giving the right answer, but also for having the right level of conviction. The best forecasters have confidence in their predictions that come true and doubt in their predictions that prove false.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_66\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"66\"/>On November 18, 2015, Jean-Pierre registered a prediction that stunned his opponents. A day earlier, a new question had popped up in an open forecasting tournament: in July 2016, who would win the U.S. Republican presidential primary? The options were Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and none of the above. With eight months to go before the Republican National Convention, Trump was largely seen as a joke. His odds of becoming the Republican nominee were <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText127\"/>only 6 percent according to Nate Silver, the celebrated statistician behind the website FiveThirtyEight. When Jean-Pierre peered into his crystal ball, though, he decided <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText128\"/>Trump had a 68 percent chance of winning.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Jean-Pierre didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just excel in predicting the results of American events. His Brexit forecasts hovered in the 50 percent range when most of his competitors thought the referendum had little chance of passing. He successfully predicted that the incumbent would lose a presidential election in Senegal, even though the base rates of reelection were extremely high and other forecasters were expecting a decisive win. And he had, in fact, pegged Trump as the favorite long before pundits and pollsters even considered him a viable contender. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s striking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jean-Pierre wrote early on, back in 2015, that so many forecasters are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstill in denial about his chances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Based on his performance, Jean-Pierre might be the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best election forecaster. His advantage: he thinks like a scientist. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passionately dispassionate. At various points in his life, Jean-Pierre has changed his political ideologies and religious beliefs.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"65_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-007-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come from a polling or statistics background; he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a military historian, which means he has no stake in the way things have always been done in forecasting. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_67\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"67\"/>The statisticians were attached to their views about how to aggregate polls. Jean-Pierre paid more attention to factors that were hard to measure and overlooked. For Trump, those included \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText130\"/>Mastery at manipulating the media; Name recognition; and A winning issue (i.e., immigration and \\xe2\\x80\\x98the wall\\xe2\\x80\\x99).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Even if forecasting isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t your hobby, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot to be learned from studying how forecasters like Jean-Pierre form their opinions. My colleague Phil Tetlock finds that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText131\"/>forecasting skill is less a matter of what we know than of how we think. When he and his collaborators studied a host of factors that predict excellence in forecasting, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText132\"/>grit and ambition didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rise to the top. Neither did intelligence, which came in second. There was another factor that had roughly triple the predictive power of brainpower.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText133\"/>The single most important driver of forecasters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 success was how often they updated their beliefs. The best forecasters went through more rethinking cycles. They had the confident humility to doubt their judgments and the curiosity to discover new information that led them to revise their predictions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A key question here is how much rethinking is necessary. Although the sweet spot will always vary from one person and situation to the next, the averages can give us a clue. A few years into their tournaments, typical competitors updated their predictions about twice per question. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText134\"/>The superforecasters updated their predictions more than four times per question.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Think about how manageable that is. Better judgment doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily require hundreds or even dozens of updates. Just a few more efforts at rethinking can move the needle. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also worth noting, though, how unusual that level of rethinking is. How many of us can even remember the last time we admitted being wrong and revised our opinions accordingly? As journalist Kathryn Schulz observes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText135\"/>Although small amounts of evidence are sufficient to make us draw conclusions, they are seldom sufficient to make us revise them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where the best forecasters excelled: they were eager to think <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_68\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"68\"/>again. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText136\"/>They saw their opinions more as hunches than as truths\\xe2\\x80\\x94as possibilities to entertain rather than facts to embrace. They questioned ideas before accepting them, and they were willing to keep questioning them even after accepting them. They were constantly seeking new information and better evidence\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially disconfirming evidence.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">On <i class=\"calibre5\">Seinfeld</i>, George Costanza famously said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText137\"/>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a lie if you believe it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I might add that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t become the truth just because you believe it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sign of wisdom to avoid believing every thought that enters your mind. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mark of emotional intelligence to avoid internalizing every feeling that enters your heart.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_68\" src=\"../images/page_65.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\">Ellis Rosen/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Another of the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText138\"/>world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top forecasters is Kjirste Morrell. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obviously bright\\xe2\\x80\\x94she has a doctorate from MIT in mechanical engineering\\xe2\\x80\\x94but her academic and professional experience wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly relevant to predicting world events. Her background was in human hip joint mechanics, designing better shoes, and building robotic wheelchairs. When I asked Kjirste what made her so good at forecasting, she replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no benefit to me for being wrong for longer. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much better if I change <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_69\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"69\"/>my beliefs sooner, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good feeling to have that sense of a discovery, that surprise\\xe2\\x80\\x94I would think people would enjoy that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Kjirste hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just figured out how to erase the pain of being wrong. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transformed it into a source of pleasure. She landed there through a form of classical conditioning, like when Pavlov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dog learned to salivate at the sound of a bell. If being wrong repeatedly leads us to the right answer, the experience of being wrong itself can become joyful.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll enjoy it every step of the way. One of Kjirste\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest misses was her forecast for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where she bet on Hillary Clinton to beat Donald Trump. Since she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a Trump supporter, the prospect of being wrong was painful\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was too central to her identity. She knew a Trump presidency was possible, but she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to think it was probable, so she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring herself to forecast it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That was a common mistake in 2016. Countless experts, pollsters, and pundits underestimated Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Brexit\\xe2\\x80\\x94because they were too emotionally invested in their past predictions and identities. If you want to be a better forecaster today, it helps to let go of your commitment to the opinions you held yesterday. <i class=\"calibre5\">Just wake up in the morning, snap your fingers, and decide you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president or what happens to your country. The world is unjust and the expertise you spent decades developing is obsolete! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a piece of cake, right? About as easy as willing yourself to fall out of love.</i> Somehow, Jean-Pierre Beugoms managed to pull it off.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Donald Trump first declared his candidacy in the spring of 2015, Jean-Pierre gave him only a 2 percent chance of becoming the nominee. As Trump began rising in the August polls, Jean-Pierre was motivated to question himself. He detached his present from his past, acknowledging that his original prediction was understandable, given the information he had at the time.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Detaching his opinions from his identity was harder. Jean-Pierre didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want Trump to win, so it would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been easy to fall into the trap of <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_70\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"70\"/>desirability bias. He overcame it by focusing on a different goal. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so attached to my original forecast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained, because of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe desire to win, the desire to be the best forecaster.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He still had a stake in the outcome he actually preferred, but he had an even bigger stake in not making a mistake. His values put truth above tribe: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the evidence strongly suggests that my tribe is wrong on a particular issue, then so be it. I consider all of my opinions tentative. When the facts change, I change my opinions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Research suggests that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText139\"/>identifying even a single reason why we might be wrong can be enough to curb overconfidence. Jean-Pierre went further; he made a list of all the arguments that pundits were making about why Trump couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win and went looking for evidence that they (and he) were wrong. He found that evidence within the polls: in contrast with widespread claims that Trump was a factional candidate with narrow appeal, Jean-Pierre saw that Trump was popular across key Republican demographic groups. By mid-September, Jean-Pierre was an outlier, putting Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s odds of becoming the nominee over 50 percent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccept the fact that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jean-Pierre advises. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTry to disprove yourself. When you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wrong, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something to be depressed about. Say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hey, I discovered something!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_70\" src=\"../images/page_67_2.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_71\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"71\" class=\"calibre3\"/>MISTAKES WERE MADE\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. MOST LIKELY BY ME</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">As prescient as Jean-Pierre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bet on Trump was, he still had trouble sticking to it in the face of his feelings. In the spring of 2016, he identified the media coverage of Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails as a red flag, and kept predicting a Trump victory for two months more. By the summer, though, as he contemplated the impending possibility of a Trump presidency, he found himself struggling to sleep at night. He changed his forecast to Clinton.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_71\" src=\"../images/page_67.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Looking back, Jean-Pierre isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t defensive about his decision. He freely admits that despite being an experienced forecaster, he made the rookie mistake of falling victim to desirability bias, allowing his preference to cloud his judgment. He focused on the forces that would enable him to predict a Clinton win because he desperately wanted a Trump loss. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was just a way of me trying to deal with this unpleasant forecast I had issued,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. Then he does something unexpected: he laughs at himself.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_72\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"72\"/>If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re insecure, we make fun of others. If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re comfortable being wrong, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not afraid to poke fun at ourselves. Laughing at ourselves reminds us that although we might take our decisions seriously, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to take <i class=\"calibre5\">ourselves</i> too seriously. Research suggests that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText140\"/>the more frequently we make fun of ourselves, the happier we tend to be.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"66_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3\" id=\"footnote-006-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> Instead of beating ourselves up about our mistakes, we can turn some of our past misconceptions into sources of present amusement.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Being wrong won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always be joyful. The path to embracing mistakes is full of painful moments, and we handle those moments better when we remember they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re essential for progress. But if we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t learn to find occasional glee in discovering we were wrong, it will be awfully hard to get anything right.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed a paradox in great scientists and superforecasters: the reason they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so comfortable being wrong is that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re terrified of being wrong. What sets them apart is the time horizon. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re determined to reach the correct answer in the long run, and they know that means they have to be open to stumbling, backtracking, and rerouting in the short run. They shun rose-colored glasses in favor of a sturdy mirror. The fear of missing the mark next year is a powerful motivator to get a crystal-clear view of last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mistakes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText141\"/>People who are right a lot listen a lot, and they change their mind a lot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jeff Bezos says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change your mind frequently, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be wrong a lot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Jean-Pierre Beugoms has a favorite trick for catching himself when he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong. When he makes a forecast, he also makes a list of the conditions in which it should hold true\\xe2\\x80\\x94as well as the conditions under which he would change his mind. He explains that this keeps him honest, preventing him from getting attached to a bad prediction.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_73\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"73\"/>What forecasters do in tournaments is good practice in life. When you form an opinion, ask yourself what would have to happen to prove it false. Then keep track of your views so you can see when you were right, when you were wrong, and how your thinking has evolved. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI started out just wanting to prove myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jean-Pierre says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I want to improve myself\\xe2\\x80\\x94to see how good I can get.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one thing to admit to ourselves that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been wrong. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another thing to confess that to other people. Even if we manage to overthrow our inner dictator, we run the risk of facing outer ridicule. In some cases we fear that if others find out we were wrong, it could destroy our reputations. How do people who accept being wrong cope with that?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the early 1990s, the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText143\"/>British physicist Andrew Lyne published a major discovery in the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most prestigious science journal. He presented the first evidence that a planet could orbit a neutron star\\xe2\\x80\\x94a star that had exploded into a supernova. Several months later, while preparing to give a presentation at an astronomy conference, he noticed that he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t adjusted for the fact that the Earth moves in an elliptical orbit, not a circular one. He was embarrassingly, horribly wrong. The planet he had discovered didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In front of hundreds of colleagues, Andrew walked onto the ballroom stage and admitted his mistake. When he finished his confession, the room exploded in a standing ovation. One astrophysicist called it \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText144\"/>the most honorable thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Andrew Lyne is not alone. Psychologists find that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText145\"/>admitting we were wrong doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make us look less competent. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText146\"/>display of honesty and a willingness to learn. Although scientists believe it will damage their reputation to admit that their studies failed to replicate, the reverse is true: they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re judged more favorably if they acknowledge the new data rather than deny them. After all, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText147\"/>whose fault it is that something is broken if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your responsibility to fix it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d actor Will Smith has said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaking responsibility is taking your power back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_74\" src=\"../images/page_71.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_74\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"74\"/>When we find out we might be wrong, a standard defense is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m entitled to my opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to modify that: yes, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re entitled to hold opinions inside our own heads. If we choose to express them out loud, though, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our responsibility to ground them in logic and facts, share our reasoning with others, and change our minds when better evidence emerges.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This philosophy takes us back to the Harvard students who had their worldviews attacked in that unethical study by Henry Murray. If I had to guess, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say the students who enjoyed the experience had a mindset similar to that of great scientists and superforecasters. They saw challenges to their opinions as an exciting opportunity to develop and evolve their thinking. The students who found it stressful didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to detach. Their opinions were their identities. An assault on their worldviews was a threat to their very sense of self. Their inner dictator rushed in to protect them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Take it from the student with the code name Lawful. He felt he had <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_75\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"75\"/>been damaged emotionally by the study. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur adversary in the debate subjected us to various insults,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lawful reflected four decades later. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText148\"/>It was a highly unpleasant experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Today, Lawful has a different code name, one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s familiar to most Americans. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s known as the Unabomber.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ted Kaczynski became a math professor turned anarchist and domestic terrorist. He mailed bombs that killed three people and injured twenty-three more. An eighteen-year-long FBI investigation culminated in his arrest after <i class=\"calibre5\">The</i> <i class=\"calibre5\">New York Times</i> and <i class=\"calibre5\">The</i> <i class=\"calibre5\">Washington Post</i> published his manifesto and his brother recognized his writing. He is now serving life in prison without parole.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The excerpt I quoted earlier was from Kaczynski\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manifesto.

What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disturbing is the level of conviction. Kaczynski displays little consideration of alternative views, barely a hint that he might be wrong.

They launched a newspaper and built their own printing press together. They opened a bicycle shop and then started manufacturing their own bikes together. And after years of toiling away at a seemingly impossible problem, they invented the first successful airplane together.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText151\"/>Wilbur and Orville Wright first caught the flying bug when their father brought home a toy helicopter. After it broke, they built one of their own. As they advanced from playing together to working together to rethinking human flight together, there was no trace of sibling rivalry between them. Wilbur even said they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthought together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Even though it was Wilbur who launched the project, the brothers shared equal credit for their achievement. When it came time to decide who would pilot their historic flight at Kitty Hawk, they just flipped a coin.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_78\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"78\"/>New ways of thinking often spring from old bonds. The comedic chemistry of <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText152\"/>Tina Fey and Amy Poehler can be traced back to their early twenties, when they immediately hit it off in an improv class. The musical harmony of the Beatles started even earlier, when they were in high school. Just minutes after a mutual friend introduced them, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText153\"/>Paul McCartney was teaching John Lennon how to tune a guitar. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText154\"/>Ben &amp; Jerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ice Cream grew out of a friendship between the two founders that began in seventh-grade gym class. It seems that to make progress together, we need to be in sync. But the truth, like all truths, is more complicated.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">One of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading experts on conflict is an organizational psychologist in Australia named Karen \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEtty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jehn. When you think about conflict, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably picturing <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText155\"/>what Etty calls relationship conflict\\xe2\\x80\\x94personal, emotional clashes that are filled not just with friction but also with animosity. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText156\"/><i class=\"calibre5\">I hate your stinking guts.</i> <i class=\"calibre5\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use small words so that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be sure to understand, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText157\"/>you warthog-faced buffoon.</i> <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText158\"/><i class=\"calibre5\">You bob for apples in the toilet\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. and you like it.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">But Etty has identified another flavor called task conflict\\xe2\\x80\\x94clashes about ideas and opinions. We have task conflict when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re debating whom to hire, which restaurant to pick for dinner, or whether to name our child Gertrude or Quasar. The question is whether the two types of conflict have different consequences.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years ago I surveyed hundreds of new teams in Silicon Valley on conflict several times during their first six months working together. Even if they argued constantly and agreed on nothing else, they agreed on what kind of conflict they were having. When their projects were finished, I asked their managers to evaluate each team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effectiveness.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The teams that performed poorly started with more relationship conflict than task conflict. They entered into personal feuds early on and were so busy disliking one another that they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable challenging one another. It took months for many of the teams to make real headway on their relationship issues, and by the time they did manage to debate key decisions, it was often too late to rethink their directions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_79_1\" src=\"../images/ART_24_LowPerformingGroups.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_79\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"79\"/>What happened in the high-performing groups? As you might expect, they started with low relationship conflict and kept it low throughout their work together. That didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop them from having task conflict at the outset: they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hesitate to surface competing perspectives. As they resolved some of their differences of opinion, they were able to align on a direction and carry out their work until they ran into new issues to debate.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_79_0\" src=\"../images/ART_25_HighPerformingGroups.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_80\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"80\"/>All in all, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText159\"/>more than a hundred studies have examined conflict types in over eight thousand teams. A meta-analysis of those studies showed that relationship conflict is generally bad for performance, but some task conflict can be beneficial: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been linked to higher creativity and smarter choices. For example, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence that when teams experience moderate task conflict early on, they generate <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText160\"/>more original ideas in Chinese technology companies, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText161\"/>innovate more in Dutch delivery services, and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText162\"/>make better decisions in American hospitals. As one research team concluded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText163\"/>The absence of conflict is not harmony, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apathy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Relationship conflict is destructive in part because it stands in the way of rethinking. When a clash gets personal and emotional, we become self-righteous preachers of our own views, spiteful prosecutors of the other side, or single-minded politicians who dismiss opinions that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come from our side. Task conflict can be constructive when it brings diversity of thought, preventing us from getting trapped in overconfidence cycles. It can help us stay humble, surface doubts, and make us curious about what we might be missing. That can lead us to think again, moving us closer to the truth without damaging our relationships.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Although productive disagreement is a critical life skill, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one that many of us never fully develop. The problem starts early: parents disagree behind closed doors, fearing that conflict will make children anxious or somehow damage their character. Yet research shows that how often parents argue has no bearing on their children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic, social, or emotional development. What matters is how respectfully parents argue, not how frequently. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText164\"/>Kids whose parents clash constructively feel more emotionally safe in elementary school, and over the next few years they actually demonstrate more helpfulness and compassion toward their classmates.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Being able to have a good fight doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just make us more civil; it also develops our creative muscles. In a classic study, highly creative <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText165\"/>architects were more likely than their technically competent but less original peers to come from homes with plenty of friction. They often grew up in households that were \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText166\"/>tense but secure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as psychologist Robert Albert <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_81\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"81\"/>notes: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText167\"/>The creative person-to-be comes from a family that is anything but harmonious, one with a \\xe2\\x80\\x98wobble.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The parents weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t physically or verbally abusive, but they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shy away from conflict, either. Instead of telling their children to be seen but not heard, they encouraged them to stand up for themselves. The kids learned to dish it out\\xe2\\x80\\x94and take it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what happened to Wilbur and Orville Wright.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When the Wright brothers said they thought together, what they really meant is that they fought together. Arguing was the family business. Although their father was a bishop in the local church, he included books by atheists in his library\\xe2\\x80\\x94and encouraged the children to read and debate them. They developed the courage to fight for their ideas and the resilience to lose a disagreement without losing their resolve. When they were solving problems, they had arguments that lasted not just for hours but for weeks and months at a time. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have such incessant spats because they were angry. They kept quarreling because they enjoyed it and learned from the experience. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like scrapping with Orv,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wilbur reflected. As you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see, it was one of their most passionate and prolonged arguments that led them to rethink a critical assumption that had prevented humans from soaring through the skies.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE PLIGHT OF THE PEOPLE PLEASER</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">As long as I can remember, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been determined to keep the peace. Maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because my group of friends dropped me in middle school. Maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s genetic. Maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because my parents got divorced. Whatever the cause, in psychology there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a name for my affliction. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText168\"/>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called agreeableness, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the major personality traits around the world. Agreeable people tend to be nice. Friendly. Polite.

They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not just comfortable with conflict; it energizes them. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText171\"/>If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re highly disagreeable, you might be happier in an argument than in a friendly conversation. That quality often comes with a bad rap: disagreeable people get stereotyped as curmudgeons who complain about every idea, or Dementors who suck the joy out of every meeting. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText172\"/>When I studied Pixar, though, I came away with a dramatically different view.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In 2000, Pixar was on fire. Their teams had used computers to rethink animation in their first blockbuster, <i class=\"calibre5\">Toy Story</i>, and they were fresh off two more smash hits. Yet the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founders weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t content to <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_83\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"83\"/>rest on their laurels. They recruited an outside director named Brad Bird to shake things up. Brad had just released his debut film, which was well reviewed but flopped at the box office, so he was itching to do something big and bold. When he pitched his vision, the technical leadership at Pixar said it was impossible: they would need a decade and $500 million to make it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Brad wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ready to give up. He sought out the biggest misfits at Pixar for his project\\xe2\\x80\\x94people who were disagreeable, disgruntled, and dissatisfied. Some called them black sheep. Others called them pirates. When Brad rounded them up, he warned them that no one believed they could pull off the project. Just four years later, his team didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t only succeed in releasing Pixar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most complex film ever; they actually managed to lower the cost of production per minute. <i class=\"calibre5\">The Incredibles</i> went on to gross upwards of $631 million worldwide and won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Notice what Brad didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stock his team with agreeable people. Agreeable people make for a great support network: they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re excited to encourage us and cheerlead for us. Rethinking depends on a different kind of network: a challenge network, a group of people we trust to point out our blind spots and help us overcome our weaknesses. Their role is to activate rethinking cycles by pushing us to be humble about our expertise, doubt our knowledge, and be curious about new perspectives.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The ideal members of a challenge network are disagreeable, because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fearless about questioning the way things have always been done and holding us accountable for thinking again. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText173\"/>disagreeable people speak up more frequently\\xe2\\x80\\x94<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText174\"/>especially when leaders aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receptive\\xe2\\x80\\x94and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText175\"/>foster more task conflict. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like the doctor in the show <i class=\"calibre5\">House</i> or the boss in the film <i class=\"calibre5\">The Devil Wears Prada</i>. They give the critical feedback we might not want to hear, but need to hear.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Harnessing disagreeable people isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always easy. It helps if certain <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_84\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"84\"/>conditions are in place. Studies in oil drilling and tech companies suggest that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText176\"/>dissatisfaction promotes creativity only when people feel committed and supported\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText177\"/>cultural misfits are most likely to add value when they have strong bonds with their colleagues.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"30_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-010-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Before Brad Bird arrived, Pixar already had a track record of encouraging talented people to push boundaries. But the studio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous films had starred toys, bugs, and monsters, which were relatively simple to animate. Since making a whole film with lifelike human superheroes was beyond the capabilities of computer animation at the time, the technical teams balked at Brad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vision for <i class=\"calibre5\">The Incredibles</i>. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when he created his challenge network. He enlisted his band of pirates to foster task conflict and rethink the process.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Brad gathered the pirates in Pixar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theater and told them that although a bunch of bean counters and corporate suits might not believe in them, he did. After rallying them he went out of his way to seek out their ideas. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want people who are disgruntled because they have a better way of doing things and they are having trouble finding an avenue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brad told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRacing cars that are just spinning their wheels in a garage rather than racing. You open that garage door, and man, those people will take you somewhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The pirates rose to the occasion, finding economical alternatives to expensive techniques and easy workarounds for hard problems. When it came time to animate the superhero family, they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t toil over the intricate contours of interlocking muscles. Instead they figured out that sliding simple oval shapes against one another could become the building blocks of complex muscles.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When I asked Brad how he recognized the value of pirates, he told me it was because he <i class=\"calibre5\">is</i> one. Growing up, when he went to dinner at <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_85\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"85\"/>friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99 houses, he was taken aback by the polite questions their parents asked about their day at school. Bird family dinners were more like a food fight, where they all vented, debated, and spoke their minds. Brad found the exchanges contentious but fun, and he brought that mentality into his first dream job at Disney. From an early age, he had been mentored and trained by a group of old Disney masters to put quality first, and he was frustrated that their replacements\\xe2\\x80\\x94who now supervised the new generation at the studio\\xe2\\x80\\x94weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t upholding the same standards. Within a few months of launching his animation career at Disney, Brad was criticizing senior leaders for taking on conventional projects and producing substandard work. They told him to be quiet and do his job. When he refused, they fired him.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w50c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_85\" src=\"../images/27_ProjectingHate.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve watched too many leaders shield themselves from task conflict. As they gain power, they tune out boat-rockers and listen to bootlickers. They become politicians, surrounding themselves with agreeable yes-men and becoming more susceptible to seduction by sycophants. Research reveals that when their firms perform poorly, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText179\"/>CEOs who indulge flattery and conformity become overconfident. They stick to their existing <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_86\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"86\"/>strategic plans instead of changing course\\xe2\\x80\\x94which sets them on a collision course with failure.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We learn more from people who challenge our thought process than those who affirm our conclusions. Strong leaders engage their critics and make themselves stronger. Weak leaders silence their critics and make themselves weaker. This reaction isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t limited to people in power. Although we might be on board with the principle, in practice we often miss out on the value of a challenge network.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In one experiment, when people were criticized rather than praised by a partner, they were over four times more likely to request a new partner. Across a range of workplaces, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText180\"/>when employees received tough feedback from colleagues, their default response was to avoid those coworkers or drop them from their networks altogether\\xe2\\x80\\x94and their performance suffered over the following year.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Some organizations and occupations counter those tendencies by building challenge networks into their cultures. From time to time the Pentagon and the White House have used aptly named \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText181\"/>murder boards\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to stir up task conflict, enlisting tough-minded committees to shoot down plans and candidates. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText182\"/>At X, Google\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoonshot factory,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a rapid evaluation team that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charged with rethinking proposals: members conduct independent assessments and only advance the ones that emerge as both audacious and achievable. In science, a challenge network is often a cornerstone of the peer-review process. We submit articles anonymously, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reviewed blindly by independent experts. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never forget the rejection letter I once received in which one of the reviewers encouraged me to go back and read the work of Adam Grant. <i class=\"calibre5\">Dude, I am Adam Grant.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When I write a book, I like to enlist my own challenge network. I recruit a group of my most thoughtful critics and ask them to tear each chapter apart. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to consider their values along with their personalities\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking for disagreeable people who are givers, not takers. Disagreeable givers often make the best critics: their <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_87\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"87\"/>intent is to elevate the work, not feed their own egos. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t criticize because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re insecure; they challenge because they care. They dish out tough love.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"31_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3\" id=\"footnote-009-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ernest Hemingway once said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText183\"/>The most essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shock-proof sh*t detector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d My challenge network is my sh*t detector. I think of it as a good fight club. The first rule: avoiding an argument is bad manners. Silence disrespects the value of your views and our ability to have a civil disagreement.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Brad Bird lives by that rule. He has legendary arguments with his long-standing producer, John Walker. When making <i class=\"calibre5\">The Incredibles</i>, they fought about every character detail, right down to their hair\\xe2\\x80\\x94from how receding the hairline should be on the superhero dad to whether the teenage daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hair should be long and flowing. At one point, Brad wanted the baby to morph into goo, taking on a jellylike shape, but John put his foot down. It would be too difficult to animate, and they were too far behind schedule. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just trying to herd you toward the finish,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John said, laughing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just trying to get us across the line, man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pounding his fist, Brad shot back: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to get us across the line in first place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Eventually John talked Brad out of it, and the goo was gone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI love working with John, because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give me the bad news straight to my face,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brad says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good that we disagree. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good that we fight it out. It makes the stuff stronger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Those fights have helped Brad win two Oscars\\xe2\\x80\\x94and made him a better learner and a better leader. For John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part, he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t flat-out refuse to animate a gooey baby. He just told Brad he would have to wait a little bit. Sure enough, when they got around to releasing a sequel to <i class=\"calibre5\">The Incredibles</i> fourteen years later, the baby got into a fight with a raccoon and <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_88\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"88\"/>transformed into goo. That scene might be the hardest I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen my kids laugh.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T AGREE TO DISAGREE</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Hashing out competing views has potential downsides\\xe2\\x80\\x94risks that need to be managed. On the first <i class=\"calibre5\">Incredibles</i> film, a rising star named Nicole Grindle had managed the simulation of the hair, watching John and Brad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interactions from a distance. When Nicole came in to produce the sequel with John, one of her concerns was that the volume of the arguments between the two highly accomplished leaders might drown out the voices of people who were less comfortable speaking up: newcomers, introverts, women, and minorities. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common for <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText185\"/>people who lack power or status to shift into politician mode, suppressing their dissenting views in favor of conforming to the HIPPO\\xe2\\x80\\x94the HIghest Paid Person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Opinion. Sometimes they have no other choice if they want to survive.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">To make sure their desire for approval didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prevent them from introducing task conflict, Nicole encouraged new people to bring their divergent ideas to the table. Some voiced them directly to the group; others went to her for feedback and support. Although Nicole wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a pirate, as she found herself advocating for different perspectives she became more comfortable challenging Brad on characters and dialogue. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrad is still the ornery guy who first came to Pixar, so you have to be ready for a spirited debate when you put forward a contrary point of view.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The notion of a spirited debate captures something important about how and why good fights happen. If you watch Brad argue with his colleagues\\xe2\\x80\\x94or the pirates fight with one another\\xe2\\x80\\x94you can quickly see that the tension is intellectual, not emotional. The tone is vigorous and feisty rather than combative or aggressive. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disagree just for the sake of it; they disagree because they care. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhether you disagree loudly, or quietly yet persistently put forward a different perspective,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nicole <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_89\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"89\"/>explains, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe come together to support the common goal of excellence\\xe2\\x80\\x94of making great films.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After seeing their interactions up close, I finally understood what had long felt like a contradiction in my own personality: how I could be highly agreeable and still cherish a good argument. Agreeableness is about seeking social harmony, not cognitive consensus. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible to disagree without being disagreeable. Although I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m terrified of hurting other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings, when it comes to challenging their thoughts, I have no fear. In fact, when I argue with someone, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a display of disrespect\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sign of respect. It means I value their views enough to contest them. If their opinions didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter to me, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother. I know I have chemistry with someone when we find it delightful to prove each other wrong.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Agreeable people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always steer clear of conflict. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re highly attuned to the people around them and often adapt to the norms in the room. My favorite demonstration is an experiment by my colleagues Jennifer Chatman and Sigal Barsade. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText186\"/>Agreeable people were significantly more accommodating than disagreeable ones\\xe2\\x80\\x94as long as they were in a cooperative team. When they were assigned to a competitive team, they acted just as disagreeably as their disagreeable teammates.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how working with Brad Bird influenced John Walker. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural tendency is to avoid conflict: at restaurants, if the waiter brings him the wrong dish, he just goes ahead and eats it anyway. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m involved in something bigger than myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he observes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel like I have an opportunity, a responsibility really, to speak up, speak out, debate. Fight like hell when the morning whistle blows, but go out for a beer after the one at five o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That adaptability was also visible in the Wright brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 relationship. In Wilbur, Orville had a built-in challenge network. Wilbur was known to be highly disagreeable: he was unfazed by other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinions and had a habit of pouncing on anyone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea the moment it was raised. Orville was known as gentle, cheerful, and sensitive to criticism. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_90\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"90\"/>Yet those qualities seemed to vanish in his partnership with his brother. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a good scrapper,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wilbur said. One sleepless night Orville came up with an idea to build a rudder that was movable rather than fixed. The next morning at breakfast, as he got ready to pitch the idea to Wilbur, Orville winked at a colleague of theirs, expecting Wilbur to go into challenge mode and demolish it. Much to his surprise, Wilbur saw the potential in the idea immediately, and it became one of their major discoveries.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Disagreeable people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just challenge us to think again. They also make agreeable people comfortable arguing, too. Instead of fleeing from friction, our grumpy colleagues engage it directly. By making it clear that they can handle a tussle, they create a norm for the rest of us to follow. If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not careful, though, what starts as a scuffle can turn into a brawl. How can we avoid that slippery slope?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_90\" src=\"../images/ART_28_TaskConflict.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_91\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"91\" class=\"calibre3\"/>GETTING HOT WITHOUT GETTING MAD</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText187\"/>A major problem with task conflict is that it often spills over into relationship conflict. One minute you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disagreeing about how much seasoning to put on the Thanksgiving turkey, and the next minute you find yourself yelling \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou smell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Although the Wright brothers had a lifetime of experience discovering each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hot buttons, that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean they always kept their cool. Their last grand challenge before liftoff was their single hardest problem: designing a propeller. They knew their airplane couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take flight without one, but the right kind didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist. As they struggled with various approaches, they argued back and forth for hours at a time, often raising their voices. The feuding lasted for months as each took turns preaching the merits of his own solutions and prosecuting the other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s points. Eventually their younger sister, Katharine, threatened to leave the house if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop fighting. They kept at it anyway, until one night it culminated in what might have been the loudest shouting match of their lives.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Strangely, the next morning, they came into the shop and acted as if nothing had happened. They picked up the argument about the propeller right where they had left off\\xe2\\x80\\x94only now without the yelling. Soon they were both rethinking their assumptions and stumbling onto what would become one of their biggest breakthroughs.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The Wright brothers were masters at having intense task conflict without relationship conflict. When they raised their voices, it reflected intensity rather than hostility. As their mechanic marveled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they really got mad, but they sure got awfully hot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Experiments show that simply <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText188\"/>framing a dispute as a debate rather than as a disagreement signals that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re receptive to considering dissenting opinions and changing your mind, which in turn motivates the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_92\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"92\"/>other person to share more information with you. A disagreement feels personal and potentially hostile; we expect a debate to be about ideas, not emotions. Starting a disagreement by asking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan we debate?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sends a message that you want to think like a scientist, not a preacher or a prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x94and encourages the other person to think that way, too.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The Wright brothers had the benefit of growing up in a family where disagreements were seen as productive and enjoyable. When arguing with others, though, they often had to go out of their way to reframe their behavior. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonest argument is merely a process of mutually picking the beams and motes out of each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes so both can see clearly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wilbur once wrote to a colleague whose ego was bruised after a fiery exchange about aeronautics. Wilbur stressed that it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t personal: he saw arguments as opportunities to test and refine their thinking. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see that you are back at your old trick of giving up before you are half beaten in an argument. I feel pretty certain of my own ground but was anticipating the pleasure of a good scrap before the matter was settled. Discussion brings out new ways of looking at things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When they argued about the propeller, the Wright brothers were making a common mistake. Each was preaching about <i class=\"calibre5\">why</i> he was right and <i class=\"calibre5\">why</i> the other was wrong. When we argue about why, we run the risk of becoming emotionally attached to our positions and dismissive of the other side\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more likely to have a good fight if we argue about <i class=\"calibre5\">how</i>.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When social scientists asked people <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText189\"/>why they favor particular policies on taxes, health care, or nuclear sanctions, they often doubled down on their convictions. Asking people to explain how those policies would work in practice\\xe2\\x80\\x94or how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d explain them to an expert\\xe2\\x80\\x94activated a rethinking cycle. They noticed gaps in their knowledge, doubted their conclusions, and became less extreme; they were now more curious about alternative options.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Psychologists find that many of us are vulnerable to an <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText190\"/>illusion of explanatory depth. Take everyday objects like a bicycle, a piano, or earbuds: how well do you understand them? People tend to be overconfident <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_93\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"93\"/>in their knowledge: they believe they know much more than they actually do about how these objects work. We can help them see the limits of their understanding by asking them to unpack the mechanisms. How do the gears on a bike work? How does a piano key make music? How do earbuds transmit sound from your phone to your ears? People are <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText191\"/>surprised by how much they struggle to answer those questions and quickly realize <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText192\"/>how little they actually know. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happened to the Wright brothers after their yelling match.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The next morning, the Wright brothers approached the propeller problem differently. Orville showed up at the shop first and told their mechanic that he had been wrong: they should design the propeller Wilbur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way. Then Wilbur arrived and started arguing against his own idea, suggesting that Orville might be right.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As they shifted into scientist mode, they focused less on why different solutions would succeed or fail, and more on how those solutions might work. Finally they identified problems with both of their approaches, and realized they were <i class=\"calibre5\">both</i> wrong. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe worked out a theory of our own on the subject, and soon discovered,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Orville wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat all the propellers built heretofore are <i class=\"calibre5\">all wrong</i>.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He exclaimed that their new design was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<i class=\"calibre5\">all right</i> (till we have a chance to test them down at Kitty Hawk and find out differently).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Even after building a better solution, they were still open to rethinking it. At Kitty Hawk, they found that it was indeed the right one. The Wright brothers had figured out that their airplane didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a propeller. It needed <i class=\"calibre5\">two</i> propellers, spinning in opposite directions, to function like a rotating wing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the beauty of task conflict. In a great argument, our adversary is not a foil, but a propeller. With twin propellers spinning in divergent directions, our thinking doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get stuck on the ground; it takes <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_94\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"94\"/>flight.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been told it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a world record. But his opponent today presents a unique challenge.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Debra Jo Prectet is a prodigy hailing from Haifa, Israel. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just eight years old, and although she made her first foray into public debating only last summer, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been preparing for this moment for years. Debra has absorbed countless articles to accumulate knowledge, closely studied speechwriting to hone her clarity, and even practiced her delivery to incorporate humor. Now she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready to challenge the champion himself. Her parents are hoping she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make history.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Harish was a wunderkind too. By the time he was eight, he was outmaneuvering his own parents in dinner-table debates about the Indian caste system. He went on to become the European debate champion and a grand finalist in the world debate championship, and coached the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_98\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"98\"/>Filipino national school debate team at the world championship. I was <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText194\"/>introduced to Harish by an unusually bright former student who used to compete against him, and remembers having lost \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmany (likely all)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of their debates.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Harish and Debra are facing off in San Francisco in February 2019 in front of a large crowd. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been kept in the dark about the debate topic. When they walk onstage, the moderator announces the subject: should preschools be subsidized by the government?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After just fifteen minutes of preparation, Debra will present her strongest arguments in favor of subsidies, and Harish will marshal his best case against them. Their goal is to win the audience over to their side on preschool subsidies, but their impact on me will be much broader: they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end up changing my view of what it takes to win a debate.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Debra kicks off with a joke, drawing laughter from the crowd by telling Harish that although he may hold the world record in debate wins, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never debated someone like her. Then she goes on to summarize an impressive number of studies\\xe2\\x80\\x94citing her sources\\xe2\\x80\\x94about the academic, social, and professional benefits of preschool programs. For good measure, she quotes a former prime minister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument about preschool being a smart investment.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Harish acknowledges the facts that Debra presented, but then makes his case that subsidizing preschools is not the appropriate remedy for the damage caused by poverty. He suggests that the issue should be evaluated on two grounds: whether preschool is currently underprovided and underconsumed, and whether it helps those who are the least fortunate. He argues that in a world full of trade-offs, subsidizing preschool is not the best use of taxpayer money.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Going into the debate, 92 percent of the audience has already made up their minds. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one of them: it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take me long to figure out where I stood on preschool subsidies. In the United States, public education is free from kindergarten through high school. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m familiar with <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText195\"/>evidence that early access to education in the first few years of children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives may <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_99\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"99\"/>be even more critical to helping them escape poverty than anything they learn later. I believe education is a fundamental human right, like access to water, food, shelter, and health care. That puts me on Team Debra. As I watch the debate, her early arguments strike a chord. Here are some highlights:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-1p\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Debra:</span> Research clearly shows that a good preschool can help kids overcome the disadvantages often associated with poverty.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Data for the win!

Therefore, the idea that there are more important things to spend on is irrelevant, because the different subsidies are not mutually exclusive.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_100\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"100\"/>Way to debunk Harish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case for trade-offs.

I would love to live in that world, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that <i class=\"calibre5\">is</i> the world we live in. I think we live in a world where there are real constraints on what governments can spend money on\\xe2\\x80\\x94and even if those are not real, those are nonetheless political.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">D\\xe2\\x80\\x99oh! Valid point. Even if a program has the potential to pay for itself, it takes a lot of political capital to make it happen\\xe2\\x80\\x94capital that could be invested elsewhere.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-1p\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Debra:</span> Giving opportunities to the less fortunate should be a moral obligation of any human being, and it is a key role for the state. To be clear, we should find the funding for preschools and not rely on luck or market forces. This issue is too important to not have a safety net.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Yes! This is more than a political or an economic question. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a moral question.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-1p\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Harish:</span> I want to start by noting what [we] agree on.

It is terrible when they cannot get health care.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. That is all terrible, and those are all things we need to address, and none of those are addressed just because you are going to subsidize preschool. Why is that the case?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_101\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"101\"/>Hmm.

Since preschool won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be free, the underprivileged still might not be able to afford it. Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m torn about where I stand.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen arguments from both sides. Before I tell you who won, consider your own position: what was your opinion of preschool subsidies going into the debate, and how many times did you end up rethinking that opinion?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_102\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"102\"/>If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like me, you reconsidered your views multiple times.

It means you were open to learning.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Looking back, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m disappointed in myself for forming an opinion before the debate even started. Sure, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d read some research on early child development, but I was clueless about the economics of subsidies and the alternative ways those funds could be invested. <i class=\"calibre5\">Note to self: on my next trip to the top of Mount Stupid, remember to take a selfie.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the audience poll after the debate, the number of undecided people was the same, but the balance of opinion shifted away from Debra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position, toward Harish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Support for preschool subsidies dropped from 79 to 62 percent, and opposition more than doubled from 13 to 30 percent. Debra not only had more data, better evidence, and more evocative imagery\\xe2\\x80\\x94she had the audience on her side going into the debate. Yet Harish convinced a number of us to rethink our positions.

When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to persuade people, we frequently take an adversarial approach. Instead of opening their minds, we effectively shut them down or rile them up. They play defense by putting up a shield, play offense by preaching their perspectives and prosecuting ours, or play politics by telling us what we want to hear without changing what they actually think. I want to explore a more collaborative approach\\xe2\\x80\\x94one in which we show more humility and curiosity, and invite others to think more like scientists.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE SCIENCE OF THE DEAL</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">A few years ago a former student named Jamie called me for advice on where to go to business school. Since she was already well on her way to building a successful career, I told her it was a waste of time and money. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_103\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"103\"/>I walked her through the lack of evidence that a graduate degree would make a tangible difference in her future, and the risk that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d end up overqualified and underexperienced. When she insisted that her employer expected an MBA for promotions, I told her that I knew of exceptions and pointed out that she probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend her whole career at that firm anyway. Finally, she hit back: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a logic bully!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A what?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA logic bully,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jamie repeated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou just overwhelmed me with rational arguments, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree with them, but I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fight back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At first I was delighted by the label. It felt like a solid description of one of my roles as a social scientist: to win debates with the best data. Then Jamie explained that my approach wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually helpful. The more forcefully I argued, the more she dug in her heels. Suddenly I realized I had instigated that same kind of resistance many times before.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_103\" src=\"../images/29_FavoriteArgument.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\">David Sipress/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank; \\xc2\\xa9 Cond\\xc3\\xa9 Nast</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Growing up, I was taught by my karate sensei never to start a fight unless I was prepared to be the only one standing at the end. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_104\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"104\"/>I approached debates at work and with friends: I thought the key to victory was to go into battle armed with airtight logic and rigorous data. The harder I attacked, though, the harder my opponents fought back. I was laser-focused on convincing them to accept my views and rethink theirs, but I was coming across like a preacher and a prosecutor. Although those mindsets sometimes motivated me to persist in making my points, I often ended up alienating my audience. I was not winning.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For centuries, debating has been prized as an art form, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now a growing science of how to do it well. In a formal debate your goal is to change the mind of your audience. In an informal debate, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to change the mind of your conversation partner. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a kind of negotiation, where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to reach an agreement about the truth. To build my knowledge and skills about how to win debates, I studied the psychology of negotiations and eventually used what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d learned to teach bargaining skills to leaders across business and government. I came away convinced that my instincts\\xe2\\x80\\x94and what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d learned in karate\\xe2\\x80\\x94were dead wrong.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A good debate is not a war. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not even a tug-of-war, where you can drag your opponent to your side if you pull hard enough on the rope. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText196\"/>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more like a dance that hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been choreographed, negotiated with a partner who has a different set of steps in mind. If you try too hard to lead, your partner will resist. If you can adapt your moves to hers, and get her to do the same, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more likely to end up in rhythm.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In a classic study, a team of researchers led by Neil Rackham examined <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText197\"/>what expert negotiators do differently. They recruited one group of average negotiators and another group of highly skilled ones, who had significant track records of success and had been rated as effective by their counterparts. To compare the participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 techniques, they recorded both groups doing labor and contract negotiations.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In a war, our goal is to gain ground rather than lose it, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re often afraid to surrender a few battles. In a negotiation, agreeing with someone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument is disarming. The experts recognized that in <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_105\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"105\"/>their dance they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand still and expect the other person to make all the moves. To get in harmony, they needed to step back from time to time.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">One difference was visible before anyone even arrived at the bargaining table. Prior to the negotiations, the researchers interviewed both groups about their plans. The average negotiators went in armed for battle, hardly taking note of any anticipated areas of agreement. The experts, in contrast, mapped out a series of dance steps they might be able to take with the other side, devoting more than a third of their planning comments to finding common ground.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As the negotiators started discussing options and making proposals, a second difference emerged. Most people think of arguments as being like a pair of scales: the more reasons we can pile up on our side, the more it will tip the balance in our favor. Yet the experts did the exact opposite: They actually presented fewer reasons to support their case. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to water down their best points. As Rackham put it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA weak argument generally dilutes a strong one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The more reasons we put on the table, the easier it is for people to discard the shakiest one. Once they reject one of our justifications, they can easily dismiss our entire case. That happened regularly to the average negotiators: they brought too many different weapons to battle. They lost ground not because of the strength of their most compelling point, but because of the weakness of their least compelling one.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">These habits led to a third contrast: the average negotiators were more likely to enter into defend-attack spirals. They dismissively shot down their opponents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 proposals and doubled down on their own positions, which prevented both sides from opening their minds. The skilled negotiators rarely went on offense or defense. Instead, they expressed curiosity with questions like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any merit in this proposal at all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Questions were the fourth difference between the two groups. Of every five comments the experts made, at least one ended in a question <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_106\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"106\"/>mark. They appeared less assertive, but much like in a dance, they led by letting their partners step forward.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_106\" src=\"../images/page_104.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Recent experiments show that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText198\"/>having even one negotiator who brings a scientist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level of humility and curiosity improves outcomes for both parties, because she will search for more information and discover ways to make both sides better off. She isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t telling her counterparts what to think. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asking them to dance. Which is exactly what Harish Natarajan does in a debate.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">DANCING TO THE SAME BEAT</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Since the audience started out favoring preschool subsidies, there was more room for change in Harish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direction\\xe2\\x80\\x94but he also had the more difficult task of advocating for the unpopular position. He opened the audience\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind by taking a page out of the playbook of expert negotiators.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_107\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"107\"/>Harish started by emphasizing common ground. When he took the stage for his rebuttal, he immediately drew attention to his and Debra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s areas of agreement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he began, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we disagree on far less than it may seem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He called out their alignment on the problem of poverty\\xe2\\x80\\x94and on the validity of some of the studies\\xe2\\x80\\x94before objecting to subsidies as a solution.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much luck changing other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds if we refuse to change ours. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText199\"/>We can demonstrate openness by acknowledging where we agree with our critics and even what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned from them. Then, when we ask what views they might be willing to revise, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not hypocrites.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Convincing other people to think again isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just about making a good argument\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about establishing that we have the right motives in doing so. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText200\"/>When we concede that someone else has made a good point, we signal that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not preachers, prosecutors, or politicians trying to advance an agenda. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re scientists trying to get to the truth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArguments are often far more combative and adversarial than they need to be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harish told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou should be willing to listen to what someone else is saying and give them a lot of credit for it. It makes you sound like a reasonable person who is taking everything into account.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Being reasonable literally means that we can be reasoned with, that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re open to evolving our views in light of logic and data. So in the debate with Harish, why did Debra neglect to do that\\xe2\\x80\\x94why did she overlook common ground?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not because Debra is eight years old. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because she isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t human.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Debra Jo Prectet is an anagram I invented. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText201\"/>Her official name is Project Debater, and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a machine. More specifically, an artificial intelligence developed by IBM to do for debate what Watson did for chess.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">They first dreamed the idea up in 2011 and started working intensively on it in 2014. Just a few years later, Project Debater had developed the remarkable ability to conduct an intelligent debate in public, complete with facts, coherent sentences, and even counterarguments. Her <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_108\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"108\"/>knowledge corpus consists of 400 million articles, largely from credible newspapers and magazines, and her claim detection engine is designed to locate key arguments, identify their boundaries, and weigh the evidence. For any debate topic, she can instantaneously search her knowledge graph for relevant data points, mold them into a logical case, and deliver it clearly\\xe2\\x80\\x94even entertainingly\\xe2\\x80\\x94in a female voice within the time constraints. Her first words in the preschool subsidy debate were, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreetings, Harish. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard you hold the world record in debate competition wins against humans, but I suspect you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never debated a machine. Welcome to the future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Of course, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible that Harish won because the audience was biased against the computer and rooting for the human. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth noting, though, that Harish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach in that debate is the same one that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s used to defeat countless humans on international stages. What amazes me is that the computer was able to master multiple complex capabilities while completely missing this crucial one.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After studying 10 billion sentences, a computer was able to say something funny\\xe2\\x80\\x94a skill that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s normally thought to be confined to sentient beings with high levels of social and emotional intelligence. The computer had learned to make a logical argument and even anticipate the other side\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counterargument. Yet it hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t learned to agree with elements of the other side\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument, apparently because that behavior was all too rarely deployed across 400 million articles by humans. They were usually too busy preaching their arguments, prosecuting their enemies, or politicking for audience support to grant a valid point from the other side.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When I asked Harish how to improve at finding common ground, he offered a surprisingly practical tip. Most people immediately start with a straw man, poking holes in the weakest version of the other side\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case. He does the reverse: he considers the strongest version of their case, which is known as <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText202\"/>the steel man. A politician might occasionally adopt that tactic to pander or persuade, but like a good scientist, Harish does it <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_109\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"109\"/>to learn. Instead of trying to dismantle the argument that preschool is good for kids, Harish accepted that the point was valid, which allowed him to relate to his opponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective\\xe2\\x80\\x94and to the audience\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Then it was perfectly fair and balanced for him to express his concerns about whether a subsidy would give the most underprivileged kids access to preschool.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_109\" src=\"../images/ART_31_WarDanceDebate.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Drawing attention to common ground and avoiding defend-attack spirals weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only ways in which Harish resembled expert negotiators. He was also careful not to come on too strong.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T STEP ON THEIR TOES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Harish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next advantage stemmed from one of his disadvantages. He would never have access to as many facts as the computer. When the audience was polled afterward about who taught them more, the overwhelming <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_110\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"110\"/>majority said they learned more from the computer than from Harish. But it was Harish who succeeded in swaying their opinions. Why?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The computer piled on study after study to support a long list of reasons in favor of preschool subsidies. Like a skilled negotiator, Harish focused on just two reasons against them. He knew that making too many points could come at the cost of developing, elaborating, and reinforcing his best ones. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you have too many arguments, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll dilute the power of each and every one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are going to be less well explained, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if any of them will land enough\\xe2\\x80\\x94I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the audience will believe them to be important enough. Most top debaters aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t citing a lot of information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Is this always the best way to approach a debate? The answer is\\xe2\\x80\\x94like pretty much everything else in social science\\xe2\\x80\\x94it depends. The ideal number of reasons varies from one circumstance to another.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w60c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_110\" src=\"../images/ART_32_StrongPointScale.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">There are times when preaching and prosecuting can make us more persuasive. Research suggests that the effectiveness of these approaches hinges on three key factors: how much people care about the issue, how open they are to our particular argument, and how strong-willed they are in general. If they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not invested in the issue or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re receptive to our perspective, more reasons can help: <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText203\"/>people tend to see quantity as a sign <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_111\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"111\"/>of quality. The more the topic matters to them, the more <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText204\"/>the quality of reasons matters. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when audiences are skeptical of our view, have a stake in the issue, and tend to be stubborn that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText205\"/>piling on justifications is most likely to backfire. If they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re resistant to rethinking, more reasons simply give them more ammunition to shoot our views down.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just about the number of reasons, though. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also how they fit together. A university once approached me to see if I could bring in donations from alumni who had never given a dime. My colleagues and I ran an experiment testing two different messages meant to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText206\"/>convince thousands of resistant alumni to give. One message emphasized the opportunity to do good: donating would benefit students, faculty, and staff. The other emphasized the opportunity to feel good: donors would enjoy the warm glow of giving.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The two messages were equally effective: in both cases, 6.5 percent of the stingy alumni ended up donating. Then we combined them, because two reasons are better than one.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Except they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. When we put the two reasons together, the giving rate dropped below 3 percent. Each reason alone was more than twice as effective as the two combined.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The audience was already skeptical. When we gave them different kinds of reasons to donate, we triggered their awareness that someone was trying to persuade them\\xe2\\x80\\x94and they shielded themselves against it. A single line of argument feels like a conversation; multiple lines of argument can become an onslaught. The audience tuned out the preacher and summoned their best defense attorney to refute the prosecutor.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As important as the quantity and quality of reasons might be, the source matters, too. And the most convincing source is often the one closest to your audience.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A student in one of my classes, Rachel Breuhaus, noticed that although top college basketball teams have rabid fans, there are usually empty seats in their arenas. To study strategies for motivating more fans to show up, we launched an experiment in the week before an upcoming <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_112\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"112\"/>game targeting hundreds of season ticket holders. When left to their own devices, 77 percent of these supposedly die-hard fans actually made it to the game. We decided that the most persuasive message would come from the team itself, so we sent fans an email with quotes from players and coaches about how part of the home-court advantage stems from the energy of a packed house of cheering fans. It had no effect whatsoever: attendance in that group was 76 percent.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">What did move the needle was an email with a different approach. We simply asked fans one question: <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText207\"/>are you planning to attend? Attendance climbed to 85 percent. The question gave fans the freedom to make their own case for going.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Psychologists have long found that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText208\"/>the person most likely to persuade you to change your mind is <i class=\"calibre5\">you</i>. You get to pick the reasons you find most compelling, and you come away with a real sense of ownership over them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where Harish\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final edge came in. In every round he posed more questions to contemplate. The computer spoke in declarative sentences, asking just a single question in the opening statement\\xe2\\x80\\x94and directing it at Harish, rather than at the audience. In his opening, Harish asked six different questions for the audience to ponder. Within the first minute, he asserted that just because preschools are good doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that they should be funded by the government, and then inquired, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy is that the case?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He went on to ask whether preschools were underprovided, whether they did help the most disadvantaged\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then why they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, why they were so costly, and who they actually helped instead.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Taken together, these techniques increase the odds that during a disagreement, other people will abandon an overconfidence cycle and engage in a rethinking cycle. When we point out that there are areas where we agree and acknowledge that they have some valid points, we model confident humility and encourage them to follow suit. When we <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_113\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"113\"/>support our argument with a small number of cohesive, compelling reasons, we encourage them to start doubting their own opinion. And when we ask genuine questions, we leave them intrigued to learn more. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to convince them that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right\\xe2\\x80\\x94we just need to open their minds to the possibility that they might be wrong. Their natural curiosity might do the rest.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That said, these steps aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always enough. No matter how nicely we ask, other people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always want to dance. Sometimes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so attached to their beliefs that the mere suggestion of getting in sync feels like an ambush. What do we do then?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HOSTILE</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Some years ago, a Wall Street firm brought me in to consult on a project to attract and retain junior analysts and associates. After two months of research I submitted a report with twenty-six data-driven recommendations. In the middle of my presentation to the leadership team, one of the members interrupted and asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we just pay them more?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I told him money alone probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a difference. Many studies across a range of industries have shown that once people are earning enough to meet their basic needs, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText209\"/>paying them more doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop them from leaving bad jobs and bad bosses. The executive started arguing with me: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found in <i class=\"calibre5\">my</i> experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I fired back in prosecutor mode: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I brought you randomized, controlled experiments with longitudinal data: to learn rigorously from many people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiences, not idiosyncratically from yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The executive pushed back, insisting that his company was different, so I rattled off some basic statistics from his own employees. In surveys and interviews, a grand total of zero had even mentioned compensation. They were already well paid (read: overpaid), and if that could have solved <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_114\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"114\"/>the problem, it already would have.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"32_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-013-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> But the executive still refused to budge. Finally I became so exasperated that I did something out of character. I shot back, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen a group of smart people act so dumb.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText210\"/>hierarchy of disagreement created by computer scientist Paul Graham, the highest form of argument is refuting the central point, and the lowest is name-calling. In a matter of seconds I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d devolved from logic bully to playground bully.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_114\" src=\"../images/33_HierarchyOfDisagreement.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If I could do that session over, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d start with common ground and fewer data points. Instead of attacking their beliefs with my research, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ask them what would open their minds to my data.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years later, I had a chance to test that approach. During a keynote speech on creativity, I cited evidence that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText211\"/>Beethoven and Mozart didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have higher hit rates than some of their peers; they generated a larger volume of work, which gave them more shots at greatness. A <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_115\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"115\"/>member of the audience interrupted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBullsh*t!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disrespecting the great masters of music. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re totally ignorant\\xe2\\x80\\x94you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Instead of reacting right then, I waited a few minutes until a scheduled break and then made my way to my heckler.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re welcome to disagree with the data, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a respectful way to express your opinion.

I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I succeeded in changing his mind, but I had done a better job of opening it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When someone becomes hostile, if you respond by viewing the argument as a war, you can either attack or retreat. If instead you treat it as a dance, you have another option\\xe2\\x80\\x94you can sidestep. Having a conversation about the conversation shifts attention away from the substance of the disagreement and toward the process for having a dialogue. The more anger and hostility the other person expresses, the more curiosity and interest you show. When someone is losing control, your tranquility is a sign of strength. It takes the wind out of their emotional sails. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty rare for someone to respond by screaming \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSCREAMING IS MY PREFERRED MODE OF COMMUNICATION!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This is a fifth move that expert negotiators made more often than average negotiators. They were more likely to comment on their feelings <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_116\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"116\"/>about the process and test their understanding of the other side\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings: <i class=\"calibre5\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m disappointed in the way this discussion has unfolded\\xe2\\x80\\x94are you frustrated with it? I was hoping you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see this proposal as fair\\xe2\\x80\\x94do I understand correctly that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any merit in this approach at all? Honestly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little confused by your reaction to my data\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t value the kind of work I do, why did you hire me?</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In a heated argument, you can always stop and ask, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat evidence would change your mind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If the answer is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no point in continuing the debate. You can lead a horse to water, but you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it think.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE STRENGTH OF WEAK OPINIONS</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">When we hit a brick wall in a debate, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to stop talking altogether. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agree to disagree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t end a discussion. It should start a new conversation, with a focus on understanding and learning rather than arguing and persuading. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do in scientist mode: take the long view and ask how we could have handled the debate more effectively. Doing so might land us in a better position to make the same case to a different person\\xe2\\x80\\x94or to make a different case to the same person on a different day.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When I asked one of the Wall Street executives for advice on how to approach debates differently in the future, he suggested expressing less conviction. I could easily have countered that I was uncertain about which of my twenty-six recommendations might be relevant. I could also have conceded that although money didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t usually solve the problem, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never seen anyone test the effect of million-dollar retention bonuses. <i class=\"calibre5\">That would be a fun experiment to run, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think?</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years ago, I argued in my book <i class=\"calibre5\">Originals</i> that if we want to fight groupthink, it helps to have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrong opinions, weakly held.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Since then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve changed my mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94I now believe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mistake. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText212\"/>If we hold an <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_117\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"117\"/>opinion weakly, expressing it strongly can backfire. Communicating it with some uncertainty signals confident humility, invites curiosity, and leads to a more nuanced discussion. Research shows that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText213\"/>in courtrooms, expert witnesses and deliberating jurors are more credible and more persuasive when they express moderate confidence, rather than high or low confidence.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"33_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-012-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> And these principles aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t limited to debates\\xe2\\x80\\x94they apply in a wide range of situations where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re advocating for our beliefs or even for ourselves.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In 2014, a young <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText214\"/>woman named Michele Hansen came across a job opening for a product manager at an investment company. She was excited about the position but she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t qualified for it: she had no background in finance and lacked the required number of years of experience. If you were in her shoes and you decided to go for it, what would you say in your cover letter?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_117\" src=\"../images/ART_34_Lazy.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_118\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"118\"/>The natural starting point would be to emphasize your strengths and downplay your weaknesses. As Michael Scott deadpanned on <i class=\"calibre5\">The Office</i>, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText216\"/>I work too hard, I care too much, and sometimes I can be too invested in my job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But Michele Hansen did the opposite, taking a page out of the George Costanza playbook on <i class=\"calibre5\">Seinfeld</i>: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText217\"/>My name is George. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m unemployed and I live with my parents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rather than trying to hide her shortcomings, Michele opened with them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m probably not the candidate you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been envisioning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her cover letter began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a decade of experience as a Product Manager nor am I a Certified Financial Planner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After establishing the drawbacks of her case, she emphasized a few reasons to hire her anyway:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-1p\">But what I do have are skills that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be taught. I take ownership of projects far beyond my pay grade and what is in my defined scope of responsibilities. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait for people to tell me what to do and go seek for myself what needs to be done. I invest myself deeply in my projects and it shows in everything I do, from my projects at work to my projects that I undertake on my own time at night. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m entrepreneurial, I get things done, and I know I would make an excellent right hand for the co-founder leading this project. I love breaking new ground and starting with a blank slate. (And any of my previous bosses would be able to attest to these traits.)</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A week later a recruiter contacted her for a phone screen, and then she had another phone screen with the team. On the calls, she asked about experiments they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d run recently that had surprised them. The question itself surprised the team\\xe2\\x80\\x94they ended up talking about times when they were sure they were right but were later proven wrong. Michele got the job, thrived, and was promoted to lead product development. This success isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t unique to her: there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence that people are more <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_119\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"119\"/>interested in hiring <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText218\"/>candidates who acknowledge legitimate weaknesses as opposed to bragging or humblebragging.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Even after recognizing that she was fighting an uphill battle, Michele didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go on defense or offense. She didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t preach her qualifications or prosecute the problems with the job description. By agreeing with the argument against her in her cover letter, she preempted knee-jerk rejection, demonstrating that she was self-aware enough to discern her shortcomings and secure enough to admit them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">An informed audience is going to spot the holes in our case anyway. We might as well get credit for having the humility to look for them, the foresight to spot them, and the integrity to acknowledge them. By emphasizing a small number of core strengths, Michele avoided argument dilution, focusing attention on her strongest points. And by showing curiosity about times the team had been wrong, she may have motivated them to rethink their criteria. They realized that they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking for a set of skills and credentials\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were looking to hire a human being with the motivation and ability to learn. Michele knew what she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know and had the confidence to admit it, which sent a clear signal that she could learn what she needed to know.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">By asking questions rather than thinking for the audience, we invite them to join us as a partner and think for themselves. If we approach an argument as a war, there will be winners and losers. If we see it more as a dance, we can begin to choreograph a way forward. By considering the strongest version of an opponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective and limiting our responses to our few best steps, we have a better chance of finding a <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_120\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"120\"/>rhythm.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t his first time being the only Black man in the room. Before the night was out, it would be his first time having a conversation with a white supremacist.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After the show, an older white man in the audience walked up to Daryl and told him that he was astonished to see a Black musician play like Jerry Lee Lewis. Daryl replied that he and Lewis were, in fact, friends, and that Lewis himself had acknowledged that his style was influenced by Black musicians. Although the man was skeptical, he invited Daryl to sit down for a drink.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Soon the man was admitting that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never had a drink with a Black person before. Eventually he explained to Daryl why. He was a member <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_122\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"122\"/>of the Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacist hate group that had been murdering African Americans for over a century and had lynched a man just two years earlier.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If you found yourself sitting down with someone who hated you and all people who shared your skin color, your instinctive options might be fight, flight, or freeze\\xe2\\x80\\x94and rightfully so. Daryl had a different reaction: he burst out laughing. When the man pulled out his KKK membership card to show he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t joking, Daryl returned to a question that had been on his mind since he was ten years old. In the late 1960s, he was marching in a Cub Scout parade when white spectators started throwing cans, rocks, and bottles at him. It was the first time he remembers facing overt racism, and although he could justifiably have gotten angry, he was bewildered: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can you hate me when you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At the end of the conversation, the Klansman handed Daryl his phone number and asked if he would call him whenever he was playing locally. Daryl followed up, and the next month the man showed up with a bunch of his friends to see Daryl perform.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Over time a friendship grew, and the man ended up leaving the KKK. That was a turning point in Daryl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, too. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t long before Daryl was sitting down with Imperial Wizards and Grand Dragons\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Klan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest officers\\xe2\\x80\\x94to ask his question. Since then, Daryl has convinced many white supremacists to leave the KKK and abandon their hatred.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I wanted to understand how that kind of change happens\\xe2\\x80\\x94how to break overconfidence cycles that are steeped in stereotypes and prejudice about entire groups of people. Strangely enough, my journey started at a baseball game.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">HATE ME OUT AT THE BALLGAME</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYankees suck! Yankees suck!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was a summer night at Fenway Park, my first and only time at a Boston Red Sox baseball game. In the seventh <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_123\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"123\"/>inning, without warning, 37,000 people erupted into a chant. The entire stadium was dissing the New York Yankees in perfect harmony.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I knew the two teams had a century-long rivalry, widely viewed as the most heated in all of American professional sports. I took it for granted that the Boston fans would root against the Yankees. I just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it to happen that day, because the Yankees weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even there.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The Red Sox were playing against the Oakland A\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. The Boston fans were booing a team that was hundreds of miles away. It was as if Burger King fans were going head-to-head against Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in a taste test and started chanting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMcDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sucks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I started to wonder if Red Sox fans hate the Yankees more than they love their own team. Boston parents have been known to teach their kids to flip the bird at the Yankees and detest anything in pinstripes, and <span class=\"scap\">yankees suck</span> is apparently among the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText221\"/>most popular T-shirts in Boston history. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText222\"/>When asked how much money it would take to get them to taunt their own team, Red Sox fans requested an average of $503. To root for the Yankees, they wanted even more: $560. The feelings run so deep that neuroscientists can watch them light up people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds: <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText223\"/>when Red Sox fans see the Yankees fail, they show immediate activation in brain regions linked to reward and pleasure. Those feelings extend <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText224\"/>well beyond Boston: in a 2019 analysis of tweets, the Yankees were the most hated baseball team in twenty-eight of the fifty U.S. states, which may explain the popularity of this T-shirt:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_123\" src=\"../images/page_119.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_124\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"124\"/>I recently called a friend who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a die-hard Red Sox fan with a simple question: what would it take to get him to root for the Yankees? Without pausing, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf they were playing Al Qaeda\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. maybe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one thing to love your team. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another to hate your rivals so much that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d consider rooting for terrorists to crush them. If you despise a particular sports team\\xe2\\x80\\x94and its fans\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re harboring some strong opinions about a group of people. Those beliefs are stereotypes, and they often spill over into prejudice. The stronger your attitudes become, the less likely you are to rethink them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Rivalries aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t unique to sports. A rivalry exists whenever we reserve special animosity for a group we see as competing with us for resources or threatening our identities. In business, the rivalry between footwear companies Puma and Adidas was so intense that for generations, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText225\"/>families self-segregated based on their allegiance to the brands\\xe2\\x80\\x94they went to different bakeries, pubs, and shops, and even refused to date people who worked for the rival firm. In politics, you probably know some Democrats who view Republicans as being greedy, ignorant, heartless cretins, and some Republicans who regard Democrats as lazy, dishonest, hypersensitive snowflakes. As stereotypes stick and prejudice deepens, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just identify with our own group; <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText226\"/>we disidentify with our adversaries, coming to define who we are by what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just preach the virtues of our side; we find self-worth in prosecuting the vices of our rivals.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When people hold prejudice toward a rival group, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re often willing to do whatever it takes to elevate their own group and undermine their rivals\\xe2\\x80\\x94even if it means doing harm or doing wrong. We see people cross those lines regularly in sports rivalries.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"34_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-017-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> Aggression extends well <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_125\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"125\"/>beyond the playing field: from Barcelona to Brazil, fistfights frequently break out between soccer fans. Cheating scandals are rampant, too, and they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t limited to athletes or coaches. When students at The Ohio State University were paid to participate in an experiment, they learned that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText227\"/>if they were willing to lie to a student from a different school, their own pay would double and the other student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s compensation would be cut in half. Their odds of lying quadrupled if the student attended the University of Michigan\\xe2\\x80\\x94their biggest rival\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather than Berkeley or Virginia.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Why do people form stereotypes about rival groups in the first place, and what does it take to get them to rethink them?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">FITTING IN AND STANDING OUT</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">For decades psychologists have found that people can feel animosity toward other groups <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText228\"/>even when the boundaries between them are trivial. Take <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText229\"/>a seemingly innocuous question: is a hot dog a sandwich? When students answered this question, most felt strongly enough that they were willing to sacrifice a dollar to those who agreed with them to make sure those who disagreed got less.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_125\" src=\"../images/ART_37_HotDogSurvey.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_126\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"126\"/>In every human society, people are motivated to seek belonging and status. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText230\"/>Identifying with a group checks both boxes at the same time: we become part of a tribe, and we take pride when our tribe wins. In classic studies on college campuses, psychologists found that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText231\"/>after their team won a football game, students were more likely to walk around wearing school swag. From Arizona State to Notre Dame to USC, students basked in the reflected glory of Saturday victories, donning team shirts and hats and jackets on Sunday. If their team lost, they shunned school apparel, and distanced themselves by saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey lost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d instead of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe lost.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some economists and finance experts have even found that the stock market rises if a country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soccer team wins World Cup matches and falls if they lose.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"35_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-016-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText232\"/>Rivalries are most likely to develop between teams that are geographically close, compete regularly, and are evenly matched. The Yankees and Red Sox fit this pattern: they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re both on the East Coast, they play each other eighteen or nineteen times a season, they both have histories of success, and as of 2019, they had competed over 2,200 times\\xe2\\x80\\x94with each team winning over 1,000 times. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText233\"/>The two teams also have more fans than any other franchises in baseball.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I decided to test what it would take to get fans to rethink their beliefs about their bitter rivals. Working with a doctoral student, Tim Kundro, I ran a series of experiments with passionate Yankees and Red Sox supporters. To get a sense of their stereotypes, we asked over a thousand Red Sox and Yankees fans to list three negative things about their rivals. They mostly used the same words to describe one another, complaining about their respective accents, their beards, and their tendency to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmell like old corn chips.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-figure-title\">WHY RED SOX FANS HATE YANKEES FANS</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w60c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_127_0\" src=\"../images/38_WhyFansHate.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-figure-title\">WHY YANKEES FANS HATE RED SOX FANS</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w60c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_127_1\" src=\"../images/ART_38_WhyFansHate2.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_127\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"127\"/>Once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve formed those kinds of stereotypes, for both mental and social reasons it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to undo them. Psychologist George Kelly observed that our beliefs are like <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText236\"/>pairs of reality goggles. We use them to make sense of the world and navigate our surroundings. A threat to our opinions cracks our goggles, leaving our vision blurred. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only natural to put up our guard in response\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Kelly noticed that we become especially hostile when trying to defend opinions that we know, deep down, are false. Rather than trying on a different pair of goggles, we become mental contortionists, twisting and turning until we find an angle of vision that keeps our current views intact.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Socially, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another reason stereotypes are so sticky. We tend to interact with people who share them, which makes them even more extreme. This <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText237\"/>phenomenon is called group polarization, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been demonstrated in hundreds of experiments. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText238\"/>Juries with authoritarian beliefs recommend harsher punishments after deliberating together. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText239\"/>Corporate boards are more likely to support paying outlandish premiums for companies after group discussions. Citizens who start out with a clear belief on affirmative action and gay marriage develop more extreme views on these issues after talking with a few others who share their stance. Their preaching and prosecuting move in the direction of their politics. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText240\"/>Polarization is reinforced by conformity: peripheral <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_128\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"128\"/>members fit in and gain status by following the lead of the most prototypical member of the group, who often holds the most intense views.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Grow up in a family of Red Sox fans and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bound to hear some unpleasant things about Yankees fans. Start making regular trips to a ballpark packed with people who share your loathing, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only a matter of time before your contempt intensifies and calcifies. Once that happens, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re motivated to see the best in your team and the worst in your opponent. Evidence shows that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText241\"/>when teams try to downplay a rivalry by reminding fans that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a game, it backfires. Fans feel their identity is being devalued and actually become more aggressive. My first idea for disrupting this pattern came from outer space.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">HYPOTHESIS 1: NOT IN A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">If you ever leave the planet Earth, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably end up rethinking some of your feelings about other human beings. A team of psychologists has studied the effects of outer space on inner space, assessing the changes in more than a hundred astronauts and cosmonauts through interviews, surveys, and analyses of autobiographies. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText242\"/>Upon returning from space, astronauts are less focused on individual achievements and personal happiness, and more concerned about the collective good. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou develop an instant global consciousness\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell reflected. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText243\"/>From out there on the moon, international politics looks so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Look at that, you son of a b*tch.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This reaction is known as the overview effect. The astronaut who described it most vividly to me is space shuttle commander Jeff Ashby. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_129\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"129\"/>He recalled that the first time he looked back at the Earth from outer space, it changed him forever:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-1p\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText244\"/>On Earth, astronauts look to the stars\\xe2\\x80\\x94most of us are star fanatics\\xe2\\x80\\x94but in space, the stars look the same as they do on Earth. What is so different is the planet\\xe2\\x80\\x94the perspective that it gives you. My first glimpse of the Earth from space was about fifteen minutes into my first flight, when I looked up from my checklist and suddenly we were over the lit part of the Earth with our windows facing down. Below me was the continent of Africa, and it was moving by much as a city would move by from an airline seat. Circling the entire planet in ninety minutes, you see that thin blue arc of the atmosphere. Seeing how fragile the little layer is in which all of humankind exists, you can easily from space see the connection between someone on one side of the planet to someone on the other\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there are no borders evident. So it appears as just this one common layer that we all exist in.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When you get to see an overview of the Earth from outer space, you realize you share a common identity with all human beings. I wanted to create a version of the overview effect for baseball fans.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some evidence that common identity can build bridges between rivals. In one experiment, psychologists randomly assigned <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText245\"/>Manchester United soccer fans a short writing task. They then staged an emergency in which a passing runner slipped and fell, screaming in pain as he held his ankle. He was wearing the T-shirt of their biggest rival, and the question was whether they would stop to help him. If the soccer fans had just written about why they loved their team, only 30 percent helped. If they had written about what they had in common with other soccer fans, 70 percent helped.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Tim and I tried to get Red Sox and Yankees fans to reflect on their common identity as baseball fans, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t end <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_130\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"130\"/>up with more positive views of one another or a greater willingness to help one another outside emergency situations. Shared identity doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stick in every circumstance. If a rival fan has just had an accident, thinking about a common identity might motivate us to help. If he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not in danger or dire need, though, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too easy to dismiss him as just another jerk\\xe2\\x80\\x94or not our responsibility. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe both love baseball,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one Red Sox supporter commented. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Yankees fans just like the wrong team.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Another stated that their shared love of baseball had no effect on his opinions: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Yankees suck, and their fans are annoying.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">HYPOTHESIS 2: FEELING FOR OUR FOES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">I next turned to the psychology of peace. Years ago the pioneering psychologist and Holocaust survivor Herb <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText246\"/>Kelman set out to challenge some of the stereotypes behind the Israel-Palestine conflict by teaching the two sides to understand and empathize with one another. He designed interactive problem-solving workshops in which influential Israeli and Palestinian leaders talked off the record about paths to peace. For years, they came together to share their own experiences and perspectives, address one another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs and fears, and explore novel solutions to the conflict. Over time, the workshops didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just shatter stereotypes\\xe2\\x80\\x94some of the participants ended up forming lifelong friendships.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Humanizing the other side should be much easier in sports, because the stakes are lower and the playing field is more level. I started with another of the biggest rivalries in sports: UNC-Duke. I asked Shane Battier, who led Duke to an NCAA basketball championship in 2001, what it would take for him to root for UNC. His immediate reply: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf they were playing the Taliban.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d <i class=\"calibre5\">I had no idea so many people fantasized about crushing terrorists in their favorite sport.</i> I wondered whether humanizing a Duke student would change UNC students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 stereotypes of the group.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In an experiment with my colleagues Alison Fragale and Karren <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_131\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"131\"/>Knowlton, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText247\"/>we asked UNC students to help improve the job application of a peer. If we mentioned that he went to Duke rather than UNC, as long as he was facing significant financial need, participants spent extra time helping him. Once they felt empathy for his plight, they saw him as a unique individual deserving of assistance and liked him more. Yet when we measured their views of Duke students in general, the UNC students were just as likely to see them as their rivals, to say that it felt like a personal compliment if they heard someone criticize Duke, and to take it as a personal insult if they heard Duke praised. We had succeeded in changing their attitudes toward the student, but failed in changing their stereotypes of the group.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Something similar happened when Tim and I tried to humanize a Yankees fan. We had Red Sox fans read a story written by a baseball buff who had learned the game as a child with his grandfather and had fond memories of playing catch with his mom. At the very end of the piece he mentioned that he was a die-hard supporter of the Yankees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think this person is very authentic and is a rare Yankee fan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one Red Sox supporter commented. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis person gets it and is not your typical Yankee fan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a second observed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUgh, I really liked this text until I got to the part about them being a Yankees fan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a third fan lamented, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think this particular person I would have more in common with than the typical, stereotypical Yankees fan. This person is okay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Herb Kelman ran into the same problem with Israelis and Palestinians. In the problem-solving workshops, they came to trust the individuals across the table, but they still held on to their stereotypes of the group.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In an ideal world, learning about individual group members will humanize the group, but often getting to know a person better just <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText248\"/>establishes her as different from the rest of her group. When we meet group members who defy a stereotype, our first instinct isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to see them as exemplars and rethink the stereotype. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to see them as exceptions and cling to our existing beliefs. So that attempt also failed. Back to the drawing board again.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_132\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"132\" class=\"calibre3\"/>HYPOTHESIS 3: BEASTS OF HABIT</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">My all-time favorite commercial starts with a close-up of a man and a woman kissing. As the camera zooms out, you see that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes sweatshirt and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wearing a Michigan Wolverines T-shirt.

My uncle filled his basement with Michigan paraphernalia, got up at 3:00 a.m. on Saturdays to start setting up for tailgates, and drove a van with the Michigan logo emblazoned on the side. When I went back home to Michigan for grad school and one of my college roommates started medical school at Ohio State, it was only natural for me to preach my school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s superiority by phone and prosecute his intelligence by text.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years ago, I got to know an unusually kind woman in her seventies who works with Holocaust survivors. Last summer, when she mentioned that she had gone to Ohio State, my first response was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyuck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d My next reaction was to be disgusted with myself. <i class=\"calibre5\">Who cares where she went to school half a century ago? How did I get programmed this way?</i> Suddenly it seemed odd that anyone would hate a team at all.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In ancient Greece, Plutarch wrote of a wooden ship that Theseus sailed from Crete to Athens. To preserve the ship, as its old planks decayed, Athenians would replace them with new wood. Eventually all the planks had been replaced. It looked like the same ship, but none of its parts was the same. Was it still the same ship? Later, philosophers added a wrinkle: if you collected all the original planks and fashioned them into a ship, would <i class=\"calibre5\">that</i> be the same ship?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The ship of Theseus has a lot in common with a sports franchise. If you hail from Boston, you might hate the 1920 Yankees for taking Babe Ruth or the 1978 Yankees for dashing your World Series hopes. Although <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_133\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"133\"/>the current team carries the same name, the pieces are different. The players are long gone. So are the managers and coaches. The stadium has been replaced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText250\"/>You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually rooting for the clothes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jerry Seinfeld quipped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFans will be so in love with a player, but if he goes to a different team, they boo him. This is the same human being in a different shirt; they hate him now. Boo! Different shirt! Boo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a ritual. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText251\"/>A fun but arbitrary ritual\\xe2\\x80\\x94a ceremony that we perform out of habit. We imprinted on it when we were young and impressionable, or were new to a city and looking for esprit de corps. Sure, there are moments where team loyalty does matter in our lives: it allows us to high-five acquaintances at bars and hug strangers at victory parades. It gives us a sense of solidarity. If you reflect on it, though, hating an opposing team is an accident of birth. If you had been born in New York instead of Boston, would you really hate the Yankees?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For our third approach, Tim and I recruited fans of the Red Sox and Yankees. To prove their allegiance, they had to correctly name one of their team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s players from a photo\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the last year his team had won the World Series. Then we took some steps to open their minds. First, to help them recognize the complexity of their own beliefs, we asked them to list three positives and three negatives about fans of the opposing team. You saw the most common negatives earlier, but they were able to come up with some positives, too:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-figure-title\">WHAT RED SOX FANS LIKE ABOUT YANKEES FANS</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w60c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_133_0\" src=\"../images/ART_39_WhatFansLove.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-figure-title\">WHAT YANKEES FANS LIKE ABOUT RED SOX FANS</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w60c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_133_1\" src=\"../images/ART_39_WhyFansLove2.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_134\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"134\"/>Then we randomly assigned half of them to go the extra step of reflecting on the arbitrariness of their animosity:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-1p\">Think and write about how Yankee fans and Red Sox fans dislike each other for reasons that are fairly arbitrary.

The backstory was that consumer product researchers were planning to do taste tests of hot sauces in baseball stadiums. People who were randomly assigned to reflect on the arbitrariness of their stereotypes selected less fiery hot sauce for their rival\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stadium. We also gave them a chance to sabotage a rival fan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance on a timed, paid math test by assigning harder problems, and those who considered the arbitrariness of their stereotypes picked easier questions for the rival fan.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">People weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just more sympathetic toward a single fan\\xe2\\x80\\x94they changed their views toward their rival team as a whole. They were less likely to see their rival\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure as their success, their rival\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success as a personal insult, and criticism of their rival as a personal compliment. And they were more likely to support their rival team in ways that would normally be unthinkable: wearing the rival team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jerseys, sitting in its dugout at games, voting for its players in the All-Star Game, and even endorsing the team on social media. For some fans, it was almost like breaking a religious code, but their comments made it clear that they were rethinking their stances:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\">I think it is pretty dumb to hate someone just based on the sports teams they enjoy supporting.

Our next step was to examine the key ingredients behind the shift in fans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views. We found that it was thinking about the arbitrariness of their animosity\\xe2\\x80\\x94not the positive qualities of their rival\\xe2\\x80\\x94that mattered. Regardless of whether they generated reasons to like their rivals, fans showed less hostility when they reflected on how silly the rivalry was. Knowing what it felt like to be disliked for <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_136\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"136\"/>ridiculous reasons helped them see that this conflict had real implications, that hatred for opposing fans isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all fun and games.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_135\" src=\"../images/ART_40_StereotypeTimeline.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">ENTERING A PARALLEL UNIVERSE</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Outside the lab, dismantling stereotypes and decreasing prejudice rarely happen overnight. Even if people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t on guard from the start, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re quick to put their defenses up when their attitudes are challenged. Getting through to them requires more than just telling them that their views are arbitrary. A key step is getting them to do some counterfactual thinking: helping them consider what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d believe if they were living in an alternative reality.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In psychology, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText252\"/>counterfactual thinking involves imagining how the circumstances of our lives could have unfolded differently. When we realize how easily we could have held different stereotypes, we might be more willing to update our views.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"36_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3\" id=\"footnote-015-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> To activate counterfactual thinking, you might ask people questions like: How would your stereotypes be different if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been born Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American? What opinions would you hold if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been raised on a farm versus in a city, or in a culture on the other side of the world? What beliefs would you cling to if you lived in the 1700s?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already learned from debate champions and expert negotiators that asking people questions can motivate them to rethink their <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_137\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"137\"/>conclusions. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different about these kinds of counterfactual questions is that they invite people to explore the origins of their own beliefs\\xe2\\x80\\x94and reconsider their stances toward other groups.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">People gain humility when they reflect on how different circumstances could have led them to different beliefs. They might conclude that some of their past convictions had been too simplistic and begin to question some of their negative views. That doubt could leave them more curious about groups they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stereotyped, and they might end up discovering some unexpected commonalities.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Recently, I stumbled onto an opportunity to encourage some counterfactual thinking. A startup founder asked me to join an all-hands meeting to share insights on how to better understand other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personalities and our own. During our virtual fireside chat, she mentioned that she was an astrology fan and the company was full of them. I wondered if I could get some of them to see that they held inaccurate stereotypes about people based on the month in which they happened to be born. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an excerpt of what happened:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> You know we have no evidence whatsoever that horoscopes influence personality, right?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Founder:</span> That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a Capricorn thing to say.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a Leo. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to find out what evidence would change your mind.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Founder:</span> So my partner has been trying for as long as we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been dating. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s given up. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing that can convince me otherwise.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> Then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not thinking like a scientist. This is a religion for you.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Founder:</span> Yeah, well, maybe a little.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_138\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"138\"/>Me:</span> What if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been born in China instead of the U.S.? Some evidence just came out that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText255\"/>if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a Virgo in China, you get discriminated against in hiring and also in dating. These poor Virgos are stereotyped as being difficult and ornery.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"37_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4\" id=\"footnote-014-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-last\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Founder:</span> So in the West, Adam, that same discrimination happens to Scorpios.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Although the founder started out resistant to my argument, after considering how she might hold different stereotypes if she lived in China, she recognized a familiar pattern. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99d seen an entire group of people mistreated as a result of the positions of the sun and the moon on the day they happened to enter the world.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Realizing how unfair discrimination based on zodiac signs was, the founder ended up jumping in to help me build my case. As we wrapped up the conversation, I offered to do a follow-up discussion on the science of personality. More than a quarter of the company signed up to participate. Afterward, one of the participants wrote that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe biggest takeaway from this chat is the importance of \\xe2\\x80\\x98unlearning\\xe2\\x80\\x99 things to avoid being ignorant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Having grasped how arbitrary their stereotypes were, people were now more open to rethinking their views.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Psychologists find that many of <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText256\"/>our beliefs are cultural truisms: widely shared, but rarely questioned. If we take a closer look at them, we often discover that they rest on shaky foundations. Stereotypes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the structural integrity of a carefully built ship. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more like a tower in the game of Jenga\\xe2\\x80\\x94teetering on a small number of blocks, with some key supports missing. To knock it over, sometimes all we need to do is give it a poke. The hope is that people will rise to the occasion and build new beliefs on a stronger foundation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_139\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"139\"/>Can this approach extend to bigger divisions among people? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe for a minute that it will solve the Israel-Palestine conflict or stop racism. I do think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a step, though, toward something more fundamental than merely rethinking our stereotypes. We might question the underlying belief that it makes sense to hold opinions about groups at all.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If you get people to pause and reflect, they might decide that the very notion of applying group stereotypes to individuals is absurd. Research suggests that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText257\"/>there are more similarities between groups than we recognize. And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s typically more variety within groups than between them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Sometimes letting go of stereotypes means realizing that many members of a hated group aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so terrible after all. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more likely to happen when we actually come face-to-face with them. For over half a century, social scientists have tested the effects of intergroup contact. In a meta-analysis of over five hundred studies with over 250,000 participants, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText258\"/>interacting with members of another group reduced prejudice in 94 percent of the cases. Although intergroup communication isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a panacea, that is a staggering statistic. The most effective way to help people pull the unsteady Jenga blocks out of their stereotype towers is to talk with them in person. Which is precisely what Daryl Davis did.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">HOW A BLACK MUSICIAN CONFRONTS WHITE SUPREMACISTS</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">One day, Daryl was driving his car with the chief officer of a KKK chapter, whose official title was Exalted Cyclops. Before long, the Cyclops was sharing his stereotypes of Black people. They were an inferior species, he said\\xe2\\x80\\x94they had smaller brains, which made them unintelligent, and a genetic predisposition toward violence. When Daryl pointed out that he was Black but had never shot anyone or stolen a car, the Cyclops told him his criminal gene must be latent. It hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come out yet.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Daryl decided to beat the Cyclops at his own game. He challenged <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_140\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"140\"/>him to name three Black serial killers. When the Cyclops couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t name any, Daryl rattled off a long list of well-known white serial killers and told the Cyclops that <i class=\"calibre5\">he</i> must be one. When the Cyclops protested that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never killed anybody, Daryl turned his own argument against him and said that his serial-killer gene must be latent.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stupid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the flustered Cyclops replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, duh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Daryl agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right. What I said about you was stupid, but no more stupid than what you said about me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Cyclops got very quiet and changed the subject. Several months later, he told Daryl that he was still thinking about that conversation. Daryl had planted a seed of doubt and made him curious about his own beliefs. The Cyclops ended up quitting the KKK and giving his hood and his robe to Daryl.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Daryl is obviously extraordinary\\xe2\\x80\\x94not only in his ability to wage a one-man war on prejudice, but also in his inclination to do so. As a general rule, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s those with greater power who need to do more of the rethinking, both because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText259\"/>more likely to privilege their own perspectives and because <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText260\"/>their perspectives are more likely to go unquestioned. In most cases, the oppressed and marginalized have already done a great deal of contortion to fit in.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Having been the target of racism since childhood, Daryl had a lifetime of legitimate reasons to harbor animosity toward white people. He was still willing to approach white supremacists with an open mind and give them the opportunity to rethink their views. But it shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been Daryl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsibility to challenge white supremacists and put himself at risk. In an ideal world, the Cyclops would have taken it upon himself to educate his peers. Some other former KKK members have stepped up, working independently and with Daryl to advocate for the oppressed and reform the structures that produce oppression in the first place.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As we work toward systemic change, Daryl urges us not to overlook the power of conversation. When we choose not to engage with people because of their stereotypes or prejudice, we give up on opening their minds. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are living in space-age times, yet there are still so many of <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_141\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"141\"/>us thinking with stone-age minds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reflects. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur ideology needs to catch up to our technology.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He estimates that he has helped upwards of two hundred white supremacists rethink their beliefs and leave the KKK and other neo-Nazi groups. Many of them have gone on to educate their families and friends. Daryl is quick to point out that he hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t directly persuaded these men to change their minds. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t convert anybody,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gave them reason to think about their direction in life, and they thought about it, and thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I need a better path, and this is the way to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Daryl doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do this by preaching or prosecuting. When he begins a dialogue with white supremacists, many are initially surprised by his thoughtfulness. As they start to see him as an individual and spend more time with him, they often tap into a common identity around shared interests in topics like music. Over time, he helps them see that they joined these hate groups for reasons that weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t their own\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was a family tradition dating back multiple generations, or someone had told them their jobs were being taken by Black men. As they realize how little they truly know about other groups, and how shallow stereotypes are, they start to think again.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After getting to know Daryl, one Imperial Wizard didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop at leaving the KKK. He shut down the chapter. Years later, he asked Daryl to be his daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_142\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"142\"/>godfather.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

It was September 2018, and her baby wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t due until December. Just before midnight, Tobie arrived, weighing just two pounds. His body was so tiny that his head could fit in the palm of her hand, and Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne was terrified that he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t survive. Tobie spent only a few seconds in her arms before he was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit. He needed a mask to breathe and was soon taken to surgery for internal bleeding. It would be months before he was allowed to go home.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">While Tobie was still in the hospital, Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne was shopping for diapers when she saw a headline about measles spreading in her province of Quebec. She hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had Tobie vaccinated. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even a question\\xe2\\x80\\x94he <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_144\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"144\"/>seemed too fragile. She hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vaccinated her three other children, either; it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the norm in her community. Her friends and neighbors took it for granted that vaccines were dangerous and passed around horror stories about their side effects. Still, the fact remained: Quebec had already had two serious measles outbreaks that decade.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Today in the developed world, measles is on the rise for the first time in at least half a century, and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText262\"/>its mortality rate is around one in a thousand. In the developing world, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s closer to one in a hundred. Estimates suggest that from 2016 to 2018, measles deaths spiked worldwide by 58 percent, with over a hundred thousand casualties. These deaths could have been prevented by the vaccine, which has saved roughly 20 million lives in the past two decades. Although epidemiologists recommend two doses of the measles vaccine and a minimum immunization rate of 95 percent, around the globe only 85 percent of people get the first dose and just 67 percent continue to the second. Many of those who skip the shot simply do not believe in the science.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Government officials have <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText263\"/>tried to prosecute the problem, some warning that the unvaccinated could be fined up to a thousand dollars and sentenced to jail for up to six months. Many schools shut their doors to unvaccinated children, and one county even banned them from enclosed public places. When such measures failed to solve the problem, public officials turned to preaching. Since people held unfounded fears about vaccines, it was time to educate them with a dose of the truth.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText264\"/>The results were often disappointing. In a pair of experiments in Germany, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText265\"/>introducing people to the research on vaccine safety backfired: they ended up seeing vaccines as riskier. Similarly, when Americans read accounts of the dangers of measles, saw pictures of children suffering from it, or learned of an infant who nearly died from it, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText266\"/>their interest in vaccination didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rise at all. And when they were informed that there was no evidence that the measles vaccine causes autism, those who already had concerns actually became less interested in vaccinating. It seemed <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_145\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"145\"/>that no logical argument or data-driven explanation could shake their conviction that vaccines were unsafe.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This is a common problem in persuasion: <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText267\"/>what doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sway us can make our beliefs stronger. Much like a vaccine inoculates our physical immune system against a virus, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText268\"/>the act of resistance fortifies our psychological immune system. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText269\"/>Refuting a point of view produces antibodies against future influence attempts. We become more certain of our opinions and less curious about alternative views. Counterarguments no longer surprise us or stump us\\xe2\\x80\\x94we have our rebuttals ready.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne \\xc3\\x89tienne-Rousseau had been through that journey. Visits to the doctor with her older kids followed a familiar script. The doctor extolled the benefits of vaccines, warned her about the risks of refusing them, and stuck to generic messaging instead of engaging with her particular questions. The whole experience reeked of condescension. Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne felt as if she were being attacked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas if she were accusing me of wanting my kids to get sick. As if I were a bad mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When tiny Tobie was finally cleared to leave after five months in the hospital, he was still extremely vulnerable. The nurses knew it was their last chance to have him vaccinated, so they called in a vaccine whisperer\\xe2\\x80\\x94a local doctor with a radical approach for helping young parents rethink their resistance to immunizations. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t preach to parents or prosecute them. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get political. He put on his scientist hat and interviewed them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_145\" src=\"../images/41_Calvin_Hobbes.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\"><i class=\"calibre5\">Calvin &amp; Hobbes </i>\\xc2\\xa9 1993 Watterson.

It was common for therapists and counselors to accuse their substance-abusing clients of being pathological liars who were living in denial. That didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t track with what Miller was seeing up close in his own work treating people with alcohol problems, where preaching and prosecuting typically boomeranged. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople who drink too much are usually aware of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miller told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you try to persuade them that they do drink too much or need to make a change, you evoke resistance, and they are less likely to change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Instead of attacking or demeaning his clients, Miller started asking them questions and listening to their answers. Soon afterward, he published a paper on his philosophy, which found its way into the hands of Stephen Rollnick, a young nurse trainee working in addiction treatment. A few years later, the two happened to meet in Australia and realized that what they were exploring was much bigger than just a new approach to treatment. It was an entirely different way of helping people change.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Together, they developed the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText271\"/>core principles of a practice called motivational interviewing. The central premise is that we can rarely motivate someone else to change. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re better off helping them find their own motivation to change.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a student at Hogwarts, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re worried your uncle is a fan of Voldemort. A motivational interview might go like this:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">You:</span> I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to better understand your feelings about He Who Must Not Be Named.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Uncle:</span> Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most powerful wizard alive. Also, his followers promised me a fancy title.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_147\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"147\"/>You:</span> Interesting. Is there anything you dislike about him?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Uncle:</span> Hmm.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve felt it too. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m curious: are there any principles that matter so deeply to you that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be willing to take that risk?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Motivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and curiosity. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what might motivate someone else to change, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to tell people what to do; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs and behaviors<i class=\"calibre5\">.</i> That can activate a rethinking cycle, in which people approach their own views more scientifically. They develop more humility about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about alternative points of view.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The process of motivational interviewing involves three key techniques:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul class=\"calibre7\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first1\">Asking open-ended questions</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li class=\"x07-list-bulleted\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first1\">Engaging in reflective listening</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li class=\"x07-list-bulleted-last\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first1\">Affirming the person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire and ability to change</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne was getting ready to take Tobie home, the vaccine whisperer the nurses called was <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText272\"/>a neonatologist and researcher named <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_148\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"148\"/>Arnaud Gagneur. His specialty was applying the techniques of motivational interviewing to vaccination discussions. When Arnaud sat down with Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne, he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t judge her for not vaccinating her children, nor did he order her to change. He was like a scientist or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca less abrasive Socrates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as journalist Eric Boodman described him in reporting on their meeting.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Arnaud told Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne he was afraid of what might happen if Tobie got the measles, but he accepted her decision and wanted to understand it better. For over an hour, he asked her open-ended questions about how she had reached the decision not to vaccinate. He listened carefully to her answers, acknowledging that the world is full of confusing information about vaccine safety. At the end of the discussion, Arnaud reminded Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne that she was free to choose whether or not to immunize, and he trusted her ability and intentions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Before Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne left the hospital, she had Tobie vaccinated. A key turning point, she recalls, was when Arnaud \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctold me that whether I chose to vaccinate or not, he respected my decision as someone who wanted the best for my kids. Just that sentence\\xe2\\x80\\x94to me, it was worth all the gold in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just allow Tobie to be vaccinated\\xe2\\x80\\x94she had his older siblings vaccinated at home by a public health nurse. She even asked if Arnaud would speak with her sister-in-law about vaccinating her children. She said her decision was unusual enough in her antivaccination community that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was like setting off a bomb.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne \\xc3\\x89tienne-Rousseau is one of many parents who have undergone a conversion like this. Vaccine whisperers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just help people change their beliefs; they help them change their behaviors, too. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText273\"/>In Arnaud\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first study, with mothers in the maternity ward after birth, 72 percent said they planned to vaccinate their children; after a motivational interviewing session with a vaccine counselor, 87 percent were onboard. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText274\"/>In Arnaud\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next experiment, if mothers attended a motivational interviewing session, children were 9 percent more likely to be fully <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_149\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"149\"/>vaccinated two years later. If this sounds like a small effect, remember that it was the result of only a single conversation in the maternity ward\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it was sufficient to change behavior as far out as twenty-four months later. Soon the government health ministry was investing millions of dollars in Arnaud\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motivational interviewing program, with a plan to send vaccine whisperers into the maternity wards of every hospital in Quebec.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Today, motivational interviewing is used around the world by tens of thousands of practitioners\\xe2\\x80\\x94there are registered trainers throughout America and in many parts of Europe, and courses to build the necessary skills are offered as widely as Argentina, Malaysia, and South Africa. Motivational interviewing has been the subject of more than a thousand controlled trials; a bibliography that simply lists them runs sixty-seven pages. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been used effectively by health professionals to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText275\"/>help people stop smoking, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText276\"/>abusing drugs and alcohol, gambling, and having unsafe sex, as well as to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText277\"/>improve their diets and exercise habits, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText278\"/>overcome eating disorders, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText279\"/>and lose weight. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also been applied successfully by coaches to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText280\"/>build grit in professional soccer players, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText281\"/>teachers to nudge students to get a full night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sleep, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText282\"/>consultants to prepare teams for organizational change, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText283\"/>public health workers to encourage people to disinfect water in Zambia, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText284\"/>and environmental activists to help people do something about climate change. Similar techniques have <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText285\"/>opened the minds of prejudiced voters, and when conflict mediators <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText286\"/>help separated parents resolve disputes about their children, motivational interviewing is twice as likely to result in a full agreement as standard mediation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Overall, motivational interviewing has a statistically and clinically meaningful effect on behavior change in roughly three out of four studies, and psychologists and physicians using it have a success rate of four in five. There aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t many practical theories in the behavioral sciences with <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText287\"/>a body of evidence this robust.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Motivational interviewing isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t limited to professional settings\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relevant to everyday decisions and interactions. One day a friend called <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_150\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"150\"/>me for advice on whether she should get back together with her ex. I was a fan of the idea, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it was my place to tell her what to do. Instead of offering my opinion, I asked her to walk through the pros and cons and tell me how they stacked up against what she wanted in a partner. She ended up talking herself into rekindling the relationship. The conversation felt like magic, because I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tried to persuade her or even given any advice.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"38_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-020-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText288\"/>When people ignore advice, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always because they disagree with it. Sometimes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re resisting the sense of pressure and the feeling that someone else is controlling their decision. To protect their freedom, instead of giving commands or offering recommendations, a motivational interviewer might say something along the lines of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere are a few things that have helped me\\xe2\\x80\\x94do you think any of them might work for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_150\" src=\"../images/ART_42_BadMotivationBingo.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_151\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"151\"/>You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen how asking questions can help with self-persuasion. Motivational interviewing goes a step further, guiding others to self-discovery. You got a glimpse of it in action when Daryl Davis asked KKK members how they could hate him when they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know him, and now I want to unpack the relevant techniques in depth. When we try to convince people to think again, our first instinct is usually to start talking. Yet the most effective way to help others open their minds is often to listen.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">BEYOND THE CLINIC</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Years ago I got a call asking for help from a biotechnology startup. The CEO, Jeff, was a scientist by training; he liked to have all the necessary data before making a decision. After more than a year and a half at the helm, he still hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rolled out a vision for the company, and it was in danger of failing. A trio of consultants tried to convince him to offer some direction, and he fired them all. Before the head of HR threw in the towel, she threw a Hail Mary pass and contacted an academic. It was the perfect time for a motivational interview: Jeff seemed reluctant to change, and I had no idea why. When we met, I decided to see if I could help him find his motivation to change. Here are the pivotal moments from our conversation:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> I really enjoy being the guy who gets hired after three consultants get fired. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to hear how they screwed up.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Jeff:</span> The first consultant gave me answers instead of asking questions. That was arrogant: how could he solve a problem before he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d even taken the time to understand it? The next two did a better job learning from me, but they still ended up trying to tell me how to do my job.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> So why did you bother to bring in another outsider?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_152\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"152\"/>Jeff:</span> I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking for some fresh ideas on leadership.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my place to tell you how to lead. What does leadership mean to you?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Jeff:</span> Making systemic decisions, having a well-thought-out strategy.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> Are there any leaders you admire for those qualities?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-last\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Jeff:</span> Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That was a turning point. In motivational interviewing, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a distinction between <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText289\"/>sustain talk and change talk. Sustain talk is commentary about maintaining the status quo. Change talk is referencing a desire, ability, need, or commitment to make adjustments. When contemplating a change, many people are ambivalent\\xe2\\x80\\x94they have some reasons to consider it but also some reasons to stay the course. Miller and Rollnick suggest asking about and listening for change talk, and then posing some questions about why and how they might change.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Say you have a friend who mentions a desire to stop smoking. You might respond by asking why she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s considering quitting. If she says a doctor recommended it, you might follow up by inquiring about her own motivations: what does she think of the idea? If she offers a reason why she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determined to stop, you might ask what her first step toward quitting could be. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText290\"/>Change talk is a golden thread,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d clinical psychologist Theresa Moyers says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you need to do is you need to pick that thread up and pull it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I did with Jeff.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> What do you appreciate most about the leaders you named?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Jeff:</span> They all had vivid visions. They inspired people to achieve extraordinary things.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\">Me:</span> Interesting. If Steve Jobs were in your shoes right now, what do you think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-last\"><span class=\"_6-dialogue-speaker\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_153\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"153\"/>Jeff:</span> He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d probably get his leadership team fired up about a bold idea and create a reality distortion field to make it seem possible. Maybe I should do that, too.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few weeks later, Jeff stood up at an executive off-site to deliver his first-ever vision speech. When I heard about it, I was beaming with pride: I had conquered my inner logic bully and led him to find his own motivation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Unfortunately, the board ended up shutting down the company anyway.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Jeff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech had fallen flat. He stumbled through notes on a napkin and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stir up enthusiasm about the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direction. I had overlooked a key step\\xe2\\x80\\x94helping him think about how to execute the change effectively.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fourth technique of motivational interviewing, which is often recommended for the end of a conversation and for transition points: summarizing. The idea is to explain your understanding of other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasons for change, to check on whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve missed or misrepresented anything, and to inquire about their plans and possible next steps.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The objective is not to be a leader or a follower, but a guide. Miller and Rollnick liken it to hiring a tour guide in a foreign country: we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want her to order us around, but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want her to follow us around, either. I was so excited that Jeff had decided to share his vision that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask any questions about what it was\\xe2\\x80\\x94or how he would present it. I had worked with him to rethink whether and when to give a speech, but not what was in it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If I could go back, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ask Jeff how he was considering conveying his message and how he thought his team would receive it. A good guide doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop at helping people change their beliefs or behaviors. Our work isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done until we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve helped them accomplish their goals.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Part of the beauty of motivational interviewing is that it generates more openness in both directions. Listening can encourage others to <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_154\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"154\"/>reconsider their stance toward us, but it also gives us information that can lead us to question our own views about them. If we take the practices of motivational interviewing seriously, we might become the ones who think again.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not hard to grasp how motivational interviewing can be effective for consultants, doctors, therapists, teachers, and coaches. When people have sought out our assistance\\xe2\\x80\\x94or accepted that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our job to help\\xe2\\x80\\x94we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a position to earn their trust. Yet we all face situations in which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tempted to steer people in the direction we prefer. Parents and mentors often believe they know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best for their children and prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9s. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_155\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"155\"/>Salespeople, fundraisers, and entrepreneurs have a vested interest in getting to yes.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_154\" src=\"../images/ART_43_WillYouChangeMyMind.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Motivational interviewing pioneers Miller and Rollnick have long warned that the technique shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be used manipulatively. Psychologists have found that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText291\"/>when people detect an attempt at influence, they have sophisticated defense mechanisms. The moment people feel that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to persuade them, our behavior takes on a different meaning. A straightforward question is seen as a political tactic, a reflective listening statement comes across as a prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maneuvering, an affirmation of their ability to change sounds like a preacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proselytizing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Motivational interviewing requires a genuine desire to help people reach their goals. Jeff and I both wanted his company to succeed. Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne and Arnaud both wanted Tobie to be healthy. If your goals don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to be aligned, how do you help people change their own minds?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE ART OF INFLUENTIAL LISTENING</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText292\"/>Betty Bigombe had already hiked eight miles through the jungle, and there was still no sign of life. She was no stranger to a long walk: growing up in northern Uganda, she walked four miles each way to school. She subsisted on one meal a day in a communal homestead where her uncle had eight wives. Now she had made it all the way to the Ugandan Parliament, and she was undertaking a challenge that none of her colleagues would brave: trying to make peace with a warlord.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText293\"/>Joseph Kony was the leader of the Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Resistance Army. He and his rebel group would eventually be held responsible for murdering over a hundred thousand people, abducting over thirty thousand children, and displacing over two million Ugandans. In the early 1990s, Betty convinced the Ugandan president to send her in to see if she could stop the violence.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Betty finally made contact with the rebels after months of <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_156\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"156\"/>effort, they were insulted at the prospect of negotiating with a woman. Yet Betty negotiated her way into getting permission to meet Kony himself. Soon he was referring to her as Mummy, and he even agreed to leave the jungle to start peace talks. Although the peace effort didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t succeed, opening Kony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind to conversation was a remarkable accomplishment in itself.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"39_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-019-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> For her efforts to end the violence, Betty was named Uganda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Woman of the Year. When I spoke to her recently, I asked how she had succeeded in getting through to Kony and his people. The key, she explained, was not persuading or even coaxing, but listening.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Listening well is more than a matter of talking less. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a set of skills in asking and responding. It starts with showing more interest in other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests rather than trying to judge their status or prove our own. We can all get better at asking \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText294\"/>truly curious questions that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the hidden agenda of fixing, saving, advising, convincing or correcting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d journalist Kate Murphy writes, and helping to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfacilitate the clear expression of another person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"40_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3\" id=\"footnote-018-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to get people to change, that can be a difficult task. Even if we have the best intentions, we can easily slip into the mode of a preacher perched on a pulpit, a prosecutor making a closing argument, or a politician giving a stump speech. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all vulnerable to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crighting reflex,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Miller and Rollnick describe it\\xe2\\x80\\x94the desire to fix problems and offer answers. A skilled motivational interviewer resists the righting reflex\\xe2\\x80\\x94although people want a doctor to fix their broken bones, when it comes to the problems in their heads, they often want sympathy rather than solutions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_157\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"157\"/>That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Betty Bigombe set out to provide in Uganda. She started traveling through rural areas to visit camps for internally displaced people. She figured some might have relatives in Joseph Kony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army and might know something of his whereabouts. Although she hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been trained in motivational interviewing, she intuitively understood the philosophy. At each camp, she announced to people that she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there to lecture them, but to listen to them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Her curiosity and confident humility caught the Ugandans by surprise. Other peacemakers had come in ordering them to stop fighting. They had preached about their own plans for conflict resolution and prosecuted the past efforts that failed. Now Betty, a politician by profession, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t telling them what to do. She just sat patiently for hours in front of a bonfire, taking notes and chiming in from time to time to ask questions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you want to call me names, feel free to do so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you want me to leave, I will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">To demonstrate her commitment to peace, Betty stayed in the camps even though they lacked sufficient food and proper sanitation. She invited people to air their grievances and suggest remedial measures to be taken. They told her that it was rare and refreshing for an outsider to give them the opportunity to share their views. She empowered them to generate their own solutions, which gave them a sense of ownership. They ended up calling her Megu, which translates literally to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmother\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and is also a term of endearment for elders. Bestowing this honorific was particularly striking since Betty was representing the government\\xe2\\x80\\x94which was seen as the oppressor in many of the camps. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t long before people were offering to introduce her to coordinators and commanders in Joseph Kony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guerrilla army. As Betty muses, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven the devil appreciates being listened to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In a series of experiments, interacting with <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText295\"/>an empathetic, nonjudgmental, attentive listener made people less anxious and defensive. They felt less pressure to avoid contradictions in their thinking, which encouraged them to explore their opinions more deeply, recognize more nuances <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_158\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"158\"/>in them, and share them more openly. These benefits of listening aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t limited to one-on-one interactions\\xe2\\x80\\x94they can also emerge in groups. In experiments across government organizations, tech companies, and schools, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText296\"/>people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attitudes became more complex and less extreme after they sat in a listening circle, where one person at a time held a talking stick and everyone else listened attentively. Psychologists recommend practicing this skill by sitting down with people whom we sometimes have a hard time understanding. The idea is to tell them that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText297\"/>working on being better listeners, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to hear their thoughts, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll listen for a few minutes before responding.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Many communicators try to make themselves look smart. Great listeners are more interested in making their audiences feel smart. They help people approach their own views with more humility, doubt, and curiosity. When people have a chance to express themselves out loud, they often discover new thoughts. As the writer E. M. Forster put it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText298\"/>How can I tell what I think till I see what I say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That understanding made Forster an unusually dedicated listener. In the words of one biographer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo speak with him was to be seduced by <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText299\"/>an inverse charisma, a sense of being listened to with such intensity that you had to be your most honest, sharpest, and best self.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><i class=\"calibre5\">Inverse charisma.</i> What a wonderful turn of phrase to capture the magnetic quality of a great listener. Think about how rare that kind of listening is. Among <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText300\"/>managers rated as the worst listeners by their employees, 94 percent of them evaluated themselves as good or very good listeners. <i class=\"calibre5\">Dunning and Kruger might have something to say about that.</i> In one poll, a third of women said <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText301\"/>their pets were better listeners than their partners. <i class=\"calibre5\">Maybe it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just my kids who wanted a cat.</i> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common for <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText302\"/>doctors to interrupt their patients within 11 seconds, even though patients may need only <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText303\"/>29 seconds to describe their symptoms. In Quebec, however, Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne experienced something very different.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne explained that she was concerned about autism and the effects of administering multiple vaccines simultaneously, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_159\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"159\"/>Arnaud didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bombard her with a barrage of scientific facts. He asked what her sources were. Like many parents, she said she had read about vaccines on the internet but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember where. He agreed that in a sea of conflicting claims, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to gain a clear sense of whether immunization is safe.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Eventually, when he understood Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beliefs, Arnaud asked if he could share some information about vaccines based on his own expertise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI started a dialogue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe aim was to build a trusting relationship. If you present information without permission, no one will listen to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arnaud was able to address her fears and misconceptions by explaining that the measles vaccine is a weakened live virus, so the symptoms are typically minimal, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no evidence that it increases autism or other syndromes. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t delivering a lecture; he was engaging in a discussion. Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s questions guided the evidence he shared, and they reconstructed her knowledge together. Every step of the way, Arnaud avoided putting pressure on her. Even after talking through the science, he concluded the conversation by telling her he would let her think about it, affirming her freedom to make up her own mind.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In 2020, during the worst snowstorm of the winter, a married couple drove an hour and a half to visit Arnaud. They hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vaccinated any of their children, but after forty-five minutes of discussion with him, they decided to vaccinate all four of them. The couple lived in Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s village, and seeing other children vaccinated there made the mother curious enough to seek more information.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The power of listening doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lie just in giving people the space to reflect on their views. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a display of respect and an expression of care. When Arnaud took the time to understand Marie-H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns instead of dismissing them, he was showing a sincere interest in her well-being and that of her son. When Betty Bigombe stayed with displaced Ugandans in their camps and asked them to air their grievances, she was proving that what they had to say mattered to her. Listening is a way of offering others our scarcest, most precious gift: our attention. Once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_160\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"160\"/>demonstrated that we care about them and their goals, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more willing to listen to us.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If we can convince a mother to vaccinate her vulnerable children\\xe2\\x80\\x94or a warlord to consider peace talks\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to conclude that the ends justify whatever means are necessary. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth remembering that the means are a measure of our character. When we succeed in changing someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind, we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t only ask whether we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re proud of what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve achieved. We should also ask whether we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re proud of how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve achieved it.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

How about immigration, the death penalty, or climate change? If you think you can handle it, head for the second floor of a brick building on the Columbia University campus in New York. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the home of the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText305\"/>Difficult Conversations Lab.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re brave enough to visit, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be matched up with a stranger who strongly disagrees with your views on a controversial topic. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be given just twenty minutes to discuss the issue, and then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll both have to decide whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve aligned enough to write and sign a joint statement on your shared views around abortion laws. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re able to do so\\xe2\\x80\\x94no small feat\\xe2\\x80\\x94your statement will be posted on a public forum.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For two decades, the psychologist who runs the lab, Peter T. Coleman, has been bringing people together to talk about polarizing issues. His mission is to reverse-engineer the successful conversations and then experiment with recipes to make more of them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_164\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"164\"/>To put you in the right mindset before you begin your conversation about abortion, Peter gives you and the stranger a news article about another divisive issue: gun control. What you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know is that there are different versions of the gun control article, and which one you read is going to have a major impact on whether you land on the same page about abortion.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If the gun control article covers both sides of the issue, making a balanced case for both gun rights and gun legislation, you and your adversary have a decent chance at reaching consensus on abortion. In one of Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiments, after reading a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboth-sides\\xe2\\x80\\x9d article, 46 percent of pairs were able to find enough common ground to draft and sign a statement together. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a remarkable result.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">But Peter went on to do something far more impressive. He randomly assigned some pairs to read another version of the same article, which led 100 percent of them to generate and sign a joint statement about abortion laws.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That version of the article featured the same information but presented it differently. Instead of describing the issue as a black-and-white disagreement between two sides, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText306\"/>the article framed the debate as a complex problem with many shades of gray, representing a number of different viewpoints.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At the turn of the last century, the great hope for the internet was that it would expose us to different views. But as the web welcomed a few billion fresh voices and vantage points into the conversation, it also became a weapon of misinformation and disinformation. By the 2016 elections, as the problem of political polarization became more extreme and more visible, the solution seemed obvious to me. We needed to burst filter bubbles in our news feeds and shatter echo chambers in our networks. If we could just show people the other side of an issue, they would open their minds and become more informed. Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research challenges that assumption.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We now know that where complicated issues are concerned, seeing <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_165\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"165\"/>the opinions of the other side is not enough. Social media platforms have exposed us to them, but they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed our minds. Knowing another side exists isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sufficient to leave preachers doubting whether they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the right side of morality, prosecutors questioning whether they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the right side of the case, or politicians wondering whether they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the right side of history. Hearing an opposing opinion doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily motivate you to rethink your own stance; it makes it easier for you to stick to your guns (or your gun bans). Presenting two extremes isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the solution; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of the polarization problem.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Psychologists have a name for this: binary bias. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText307\"/>simplifying a complex continuum into two categories. To paraphrase <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText308\"/>the humorist Robert Benchley, there are two kinds of people: those who divide the world into two kinds of people, and those who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">An antidote to this proclivity is complexifying: showcasing the range of perspectives on a given topic. We might believe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making progress by discussing hot-button issues as two sides of a coin, but people are actually more inclined to think again if we present these topics through the many lenses of a prism. To borrow <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText309\"/>a phrase from Walt Whitman, it takes a multitude of views to help people realize that they too contain multitudes.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A dose of complexity can disrupt overconfidence cycles and spur rethinking cycles. It gives us more humility about our knowledge and more doubts about our opinions, and it can make us curious enough to discover information we were lacking. In Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiment, all it took was framing gun control not as an issue with only two extreme positions but rather as one involving many interrelated dilemmas. As journalist Amanda Ripley describes it, the gun control article \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText310\"/>read less like a lawyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening statement and more like an anthropologist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s field notes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Those field notes were enough to help pro-life and pro-choice advocates find some areas of agreement on abortion in only twenty minutes.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The article didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just leave people open to rethinking their views on <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_166\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"166\"/>abortion; they also reconsidered their positions on other divisive issues like affirmative action and the death penalty.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"41_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-026-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> If people read the binary version of the article, they defended their own perspective more often than they showed an interest in their opponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. If they read the complexified version, they made about twice as many comments about common ground as about their own views. They asserted fewer opinions and asked more questions. At the end of the conversation, they generated more sophisticated, higher-quality position statements\\xe2\\x80\\x94and both parties came away more satisfied.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For a long time, I struggled with how to handle politics in this book. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any silver bullets or simple bridges across a widening gulf. <i class=\"calibre5\">I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really even believe in political parties. As an organizational psychologist, I want to vet candidates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 leadership skills before I worry about their policy positions. As a citizen, I believe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my responsibility to form an independent opinion on each issue</i>. Eventually, I decided that the best way to stay above the fray was to explore the moments that affect us all as individuals: the charged conversations we have in person and online.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Resisting the impulse to simplify is a step toward becoming more argument literate. Doing so has profound implications for how we communicate about polarizing issues. In the traditional media, it can help journalists open people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds to uncomfortable facts. On social media, it can help all of us have more productive Twitter tiffs and Facebook fights. At family gatherings, it might not land you on the same page as your least favorite uncle, but it could very well prevent a seemingly innocent conversation from exploding into an emotional inferno. And in discussions of policies that affect all of our lives, it might bring us better, more practical solutions sooner. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what this section of the book is about: <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_167\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"167\"/>applying rethinking to different parts of our lives, so that we can keep learning at every stage of our lives.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_167\" src=\"../images/44_AnswersCartoon.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\"><i class=\"calibre5\">Non Sequitur</i> \\xc2\\xa9 2016 Wiley Ink, Inc.

It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary and spawned a wave of activism, motivating businesses to go green and governments to pass legislation and sign landmark agreements to protect the planet. History teaches us that it sometimes takes a combination of preaching, prosecuting, and politicking to fuel that kind of dramatic swing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Yet by 2018, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText312\"/>only 59 percent of Americans saw climate change as a major threat\\xe2\\x80\\x94and 16 percent believed it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a threat at all. Across many countries in Western Europe and Southeast Asia, higher percentages of the populations had opened their minds to the evidence that climate change is a dire problem. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText313\"/>In the past decade in the United States, beliefs about climate change have hardly budged.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This thorny issue is a natural place to explore how we can bring <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_168\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"168\"/>more complexity into our conversations. Fundamentally, that involves drawing attention to the nuances that often get overlooked. It starts with seeking and spotlighting shades of gray.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A fundamental lesson of desirability bias is that our beliefs are shaped by our motivations. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText314\"/>What we believe depends on what we <i class=\"calibre5\">want</i> to believe. Emotionally, it can be unsettling for anyone to admit that all life as we know it might be in danger, but Americans have some additional reasons to be dubious about climate change. Politically, climate change has been branded in the United States as a liberal issue; in some conservative circles, merely acknowledging the fact that it might exist puts people on a fast track to exile. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText315\"/>higher levels of education predict heightened concern about climate change among Democrats but dampened concern among Republicans. Economically, we remain confident that America will be more resilient in response to a changing climate than most of the world, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reluctant to sacrifice our current ways of achieving prosperity. These deep-seated beliefs are hard to change.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As a psychologist, I want to zoom in on another factor. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one we can all control: the way we communicate about climate change. Many people believe that preaching with passion and conviction is necessary for persuasion. A clear example is Al Gore. When he narrowly lost the U.S. presidential election in 2000, one of the knocks against him was his energy\\xe2\\x80\\x94or lack thereof. People called him dry. Boring. Robotic. Fast-forward a few years: his film was riveting and his own platform skills had evolved dramatically. In 2016, when I watched Gore speak in the red circle at TED, his language was vivid, his voice pulsated with emotion, and his passion literally dripped off him in the form of sweat. <i class=\"calibre5\">If a robot was ever controlling his brain, it short-circuited and left the human in charge.</i> \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText316\"/>Some still doubt that we have the will to act,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he boomed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The audience erupted in a standing ovation, and afterward <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText317\"/>he was called the Elvis of <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_169\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"169\"/>TED. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not his communication style that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failing to reach people, what is?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At TED, Gore was preaching to the choir: his audience was heavily progressive. For audiences with more varied beliefs, his language hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always resonated. In <i class=\"calibre5\">An Inconvenient Truth</i>, Gore contrasted the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctruth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with claims made by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso-called skeptics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In a 2010 op-ed, he <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText318\"/>contrasted scientists with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclimate deniers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This is binary bias in action. It presumes that the world is divided into two sides: believers and nonbelievers. Only one side can be right, because there is only one truth. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame Al Gore for taking that position; he was presenting rigorous data and representing the consensus of the scientific community. Because he was a recovering politician, seeing two sides to an issue must have been second nature. But when the only available options are black and white, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural to slip into a mentality of us versus them and to focus on the sides over the science. For those on the fence, when forced to choose a side, the emotional, political, and economic pressures tilt in favor of disengaging or dismissing the problem.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">To overcome binary bias, a good starting point is to become aware of the range of perspectives across a given spectrum. Polls suggest that on climate change, there are at least <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText319\"/>six camps of thought. Believers represent more than half of Americans, but some are concerned while others are alarmed. The so-called nonbelievers actually range from cautious to disengaged to doubtful to dismissive.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s especially important to distinguish skeptics from deniers. Skeptics have a healthy scientific stance: They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe everything they see, hear, or read. They ask critical questions and update their thinking as they gain access to new information. Deniers are in the dismissive camp, locked in preacher, prosecutor, or politician mode: They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe anything that comes from the other side. They ignore or twist facts to support their predetermined conclusions. As the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry put it in a plea to the media, skepticism is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfoundational <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_170\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"170\"/>to the scientific method,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whereas denial is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe <i class=\"calibre5\">a priori</i> rejection of ideas without objective consideration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"42_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-025-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_170\" src=\"../images/45_GlobalWarmingBelief.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The complexity of this spectrum of beliefs is often missing from coverage of climate change. Although no more than 10 percent of Americans are dismissive of climate change, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s these rare deniers who get the most press. In an analysis of some hundred thousand media articles on climate change between 2000 and 2016, prominent <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText320\"/>climate contrarians received disproportionate coverage: they were featured 49 percent more often than expert scientists. As a result, people end up <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText321\"/>overestimating how common denial is\\xe2\\x80\\x94which in turn makes them more hesitant to advocate for policies that protect the environment. When the middle of the spectrum is invisible, the majority\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will to act vanishes with it. <i class=\"calibre5\">If other people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to do anything about it, why should I bother?</i> When they become aware of just how many people are concerned about climate change, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more prepared to do something about it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_171\" src=\"../images/ART_46_ChargedTopics.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_171\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"171\"/>As consumers of information, we have a role to play in embracing a more nuanced point of view. When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reading, listening, or watching, we can learn to recognize complexity as a signal of credibility. We can favor content and sources that present many sides of an issue rather than just one or two. When we come across simplifying headlines, we can fight our tendency to accept binaries by asking what additional perspectives are missing between the extremes.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This applies when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the ones producing and communicating information, too. New research suggests that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText323\"/>when journalists acknowledge the uncertainties around facts on complex issues like climate change and immigration, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t undermine their readers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 trust. And multiple experiments have shown that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText324\"/>when experts express doubt, they become more persuasive. When someone knowledgeable admits uncertainty, it surprises people, and they end up paying more attention to the substance of the argument.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Of course, a potential challenge of nuance is that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to go viral. Attention spans are short: we have only a few seconds to capture eyeballs with a catchy headline. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true that complexity doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always make for good sound bites, but it does seed great conversations. And some journalists have found clever ways to capture it in few words.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years ago, the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText325\"/>media reported on a study of the cognitive <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_172\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"172\"/>consequences of coffee consumption. Although their headlines were drawn from the same data, some newspapers praised the benefits of coffee, while other outlets warned about the costs:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_172_1\" src=\"../images/47_Headlines.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText326\"/>The actual study showed that older adults who drank a daily cup or two of coffee had a lower risk of mild cognitive impairment, relative to abstainers, occasional consumers, and heavier consumers. If they increased their consumption by another cup or more per day, they had a higher risk than those who stayed at or below a single cup a day. Each of the one-sided headlines took seven to twelve words to mislead the reader about the effects of drinking coffee. A more accurate headline needed just twelve words to serve up a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText327\"/>jolt of instant complexity:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_172_0\" src=\"../images/48_ComplexHeadline.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Imagine if even this kind of minimal nod to complexity appeared in articles on climate change. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText328\"/>Scientists overwhelmingly agree about its human causes, but even they have <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText329\"/>a range of views on the actual effects\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the potential remedies. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible to be alarmed about the situation while recognizing the variety of ways to improve it.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"43_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3\" id=\"footnote-024-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_173\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"173\"/>Psychologists find that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText333\"/>people will ignore or even deny the existence of a problem if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not fond of the solution. Liberals were more dismissive of the issue of intruder violence when they read an argument that strict gun control laws could make it difficult for homeowners to protect themselves. Conservatives were more receptive to climate science when they read about a green technology policy proposal than about an emissions restriction proposal.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Featuring shades of gray in discussions of solutions can help to shift attention from why climate change is a problem to how we can do something about it. As we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen from the evidence on the illusion of explanatory depth, asking \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tends to reduce polarization, setting the stage for more constructive conversations about action. Here are <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText334\"/>examples of headlines in which writers have hinted at the complexity of the solutions:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x14-newspaper-headline-first\">I WORK IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. I DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T CARE IF YOU RECYCLE</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x14-newspaper-headline\">CAN PLANTING A TRILLION TREES STOP CLIMATE CHANGE? SCIENTISTS SAY IT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">SOME CAVEATS AND CONTINGENCIES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">If you want to get better at conveying complexity, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth taking a close look at how scientists communicate. One key step is to include caveats. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rare that a single study or even a series of studies is conclusive. Researchers typically feature multiple paragraphs about the limitations of each study in their articles. We see them less as holes in our work and more as portholes to future discoveries. When we share the findings with nonscientists, though, we sometimes gloss over these caveats.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mistake, according to recent research. In a series of <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_174\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"174\"/>experiments, psychologists demonstrated that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText335\"/>when news reports about science included caveats, they succeeded in capturing readers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interest and keeping their minds open. Take a study suggesting that a poor diet accelerates aging. Readers were just as engaged in the story\\xe2\\x80\\x94but more flexible in their beliefs\\xe2\\x80\\x94when it mentioned that scientists remained hesitant to draw strong causal conclusions given the number of factors that can affect aging. It even helped just to note that scientists believed more work needed to be done in this area.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We can also convey complexity by highlighting contingencies. Every empirical finding raises unanswered questions about when and where results will be replicated, nullified, or reversed. Contingencies are all the places and populations where an effect may change.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Consider diversity: although headlines often say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiversity is good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the evidence is full of contingencies. Although <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText336\"/>diversity of background and thought has the potential to help groups think more broadly and process information more deeply, that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText337\"/>potential is realized in some situations but not others. New research reveals that people are more likely to promote diversity and inclusion when the message is more nuanced (<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText338\"/>and more accurate): \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiversity is good, but it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t easy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"44_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_4\" id=\"footnote-023-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> Acknowledging complexity doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make speakers and writers less convincing; it makes them more credible. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lose viewers and readers; it maintains their engagement while stoking their curiosity.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In social science, rather than cherry-picking information to fit our existing narratives, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trained to ask whether we should rethink and revise those narratives. When we find evidence that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit neatly into <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_175\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"175\"/>our belief systems, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re expected to share it anyway.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"45_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_5\" id=\"footnote-022-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> In some of my past writing for the public, though, I regret not having done enough to emphasize areas where evidence was incomplete or conflicting. I sometimes shied away from discussing mixed results because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to leave readers confused. Research suggests that many writers fall into the same trap, caught up in trying to \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText340\"/>maintain a consistent narrative rather than an accurate record.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A fascinating example is the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText341\"/>divide around emotional intelligence. On one extreme is Daniel Goleman, who popularized the concept. He preaches that emotional intelligence matters more for performance than cognitive ability (IQ) and accounts for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnearly 90 percent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of success in leadership jobs. At the other extreme is Jordan Peterson, writing that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is NO SUCH THING AS EQ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and prosecuting emotional intelligence as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca fraudulent concept, a fad, a convenient band-wagon, a corporate marketing scheme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Both men hold doctorates in psychology, but neither seems particularly interested in creating an accurate record. If Peterson had bothered to read <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText342\"/>the comprehensive meta-analyses of studies spanning nearly two hundred jobs, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have discovered that\\xe2\\x80\\x94contrary to his claims\\xe2\\x80\\x94emotional intelligence is real and it does matter. Emotional intelligence tests predict performance even after controlling for IQ and personality. If Goleman hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ignored those same data, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have learned that if you want to predict performance across jobs, IQ is more than twice as important as emotional intelligence (which accounts for only 3 to 8 percent of performance).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re both missing the point. Instead of arguing about <i class=\"calibre5\">whether</i> emotional intelligence is meaningful, we should be focusing on <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_176\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"176\"/>the contingencies that explain <i class=\"calibre5\">when</i> it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more and less consequential. It turns out that emotional intelligence is <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText344\"/>beneficial in jobs that involve dealing with emotions, but less relevant\\xe2\\x80\\x94and maybe even detrimental\\xe2\\x80\\x94in work where emotions are less central. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a real estate agent, a customer service representative, or a counselor, being skilled at perceiving, understanding, and managing emotions can help you support your clients and address their problems. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a mechanic or an accountant, being an emotional genius is less useful and could even become a distraction. <i class=\"calibre5\">If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fixing my car or doing my taxes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay too much attention to my emotions.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In an effort to set the record straight, I wrote a short LinkedIn post arguing that emotional intelligence is overrated. I did my best to follow my own guidelines for complexity:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\">Nuance: This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to say that emotional intelligence is useless.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-first\">Caveats: As better tests of emotional intelligence are designed, our knowledge may change.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-dialogue-1p\">Contingencies: For now, the best available evidence suggests that emotional intelligence is not a panacea. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recognize it for what it is: a set of skills that can be beneficial in situations where emotional information is rich or vital.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Over <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText345\"/>a thousand comments poured in, and I was pleasantly surprised that many reacted enthusiastically to the complexified message. Some mentioned that nothing is either/or and that data can help us reexamine even our closely held beliefs. Others were downright hostile. They turned a blind eye to the evidence and insisted that emotional intelligence was the sine qua non of success. It was as if they belonged to an emotional intelligence cult.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">From time to time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve run into idea cults\\xe2\\x80\\x94groups that stir up a batch <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_177\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"177\"/>of oversimplified intellectual Kool-Aid and recruit followers to serve it widely. They preach the merits of their pet concept and prosecute anyone who calls for nuance or complexity. In the area of health, idea cults defend detox diets and cleanses long after they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been exposed as snake oil. In education, there are idea cults around learning styles\\xe2\\x80\\x94the notion that instruction should be tailored to each student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preference for learning through auditory, visual, or kinesthetic modes. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText346\"/>Some teachers are determined to tailor their instruction accordingly despite decades of evidence that although students might enjoy listening, reading, or doing, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText347\"/>they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually learn better that way. In psychology, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve inadvertently offended members of idea cults when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve shared evidence that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText348\"/>meditation isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only way to prevent stress or promote mindfulness; that when it comes to reliability and validity, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText349\"/>the Myers-Briggs personality tool falls somewhere between a horoscope and a heart monitor; and that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText350\"/>being more authentic can sometimes make us less successful. <i class=\"calibre5\">If you find yourself saying ____ is always good or ____ is never bad, you may be a member of an idea cult.</i> Appreciating complexity reminds us that no behavior is always effective and that all cures have unintended consequences.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w50c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_177\" src=\"../images/49_WrongOnTheInternet.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\">xkcd.com</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_178\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"178\"/>In the moral philosophy of John Rawls, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText351\"/>the veil of ignorance asks us to judge the justice of a society by whether we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d join it without knowing our place in it. I think the scientist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s veil of ignorance is to ask whether we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d accept the results of a study based on the methods involved, without knowing what the conclusion will be.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">MIXED FEELINGS</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">In polarized discussions, a common piece of advice is to take the other side\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective. In theory, putting ourselves in another person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoes enables us to walk in lockstep with them. In practice, though, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that simple.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In a pair of experiments, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText352\"/>randomly assigning people to reflect on the intentions and interests of their political opposites made them <i class=\"calibre5\">less</i> receptive to rethinking their own attitudes on health care and universal basic income. Across twenty-five experiments, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText353\"/>imagining other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspectives failed to elicit more accurate insights\\xe2\\x80\\x94and occasionally made participants more confident in their own inaccurate judgments. Perspective-taking consistently fails because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re terrible mind readers. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just guessing.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand someone, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a eureka moment by imagining his perspective. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText354\"/>Polls show that Democrats underestimate the number of Republicans who recognize the prevalence of racism and sexism\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Republicans underestimate the number of Democrats who are proud to be Americans and oppose open borders. The greater the distance between us and an adversary, the more likely we are to oversimplify their actual motives and invent explanations that stray far from their reality. What works is not perspective-taking but perspective-seeking: actually talking to people to gain insight into the nuances of their views. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what good scientists do: instead of drawing conclusions about people based on minimal clues, they test their hypotheses by striking up conversations.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_179\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"179\"/>For a long time, I believed that the best way to make those conversations less polarizing was to leave emotions out of them. If only we could keep our feelings off the table, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d all be more open to rethinking. Then I read evidence that complicated my thinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It turns out that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText355\"/>even if we disagree strongly with someone on a social issue, when we discover that she cares deeply about the issue, we trust her more. We might still dislike her, but we see her passion for a principle as a sign of integrity. We reject the belief but grow to respect the person behind it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It can help to make that respect explicit at the start of a conversation. In one experiment, if an ideological opponent merely began by acknowledging that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText356\"/>I have a lot of respect for people like you who stand by their principles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people were less likely to see her as an adversary\\xe2\\x80\\x94and showed her more generosity.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Peter Coleman brings people together in his Difficult Conversations Lab, he plays them the recording of their discussions afterward. What he wants to learn is how they were feeling, moment by moment, as they listen to themselves. After studying over five hundred of these conversations, he found that the unproductive ones feature a more limited set of both positive and negative emotions, as illustrated below in the image on the left. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText357\"/>People get trapped in emotional simplicity, with one or two dominant feelings.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_179\" src=\"../images/50_EmotionalConversationGraphs.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As you can see with the duo on the right, the productive conversations cover a much more varied spectrum of emotions. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not less <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_180\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"180\"/>emotional\\xe2\\x80\\x94they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more emotionally complex. At one point, people might be angry about the other person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views, but by the next minute they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re curious to learn more. Soon they could be shifting into anxiety and then excitement about considering a new perspective. Sometimes they even stumble into the joy of being wrong.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In a productive conversation, people treat their feelings as a rough draft. Like art, emotions are works in progress. It rarely serves us well to frame our first sketch. As we gain perspective, we revise what we feel. Sometimes we even start over from scratch.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_180\" src=\"../images/ART_51_ProductiveConGraph.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">What stands in the way of rethinking isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the expression of emotion; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a restricted range of emotion. So how do we infuse our charged conversations with greater emotional variety\\xe2\\x80\\x94and thereby greater potential for mutual understanding and rethinking?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_181\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"181\"/>It helps to remember that we can fall victim to binary bias with emotions, not only with issues. Just as the spectrum of beliefs on charged topics is much more complex than two extremes, our emotions are often more mixed than we realize.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"46_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_6\" id=\"footnote-021-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> If you come across evidence that you might be wrong about the best path to gun safety, you can simultaneously feel upset by and intrigued with what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned. If you feel wronged by someone with a different set of beliefs, you can be simultaneously angry about your past interactions and hopeful about a future relationship. If someone says your actions haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lived up to your antiracist rhetoric, you can experience both defensiveness (<i class=\"calibre5\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a good person!</i>) and remorse (<i class=\"calibre5\">I could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done a lot more</i>).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the spring of 2020, a Black man named Christian Cooper was bird-watching in Central Park when a white woman walked by with her dog. He respectfully asked her to put the dog on a leash, as the nearby signs required. When she refused, he stayed calm and started filming her on his phone. She responded by informing him that she was going to call the police and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctell them there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an African American man threatening my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She went on to do exactly that with a 911 operator.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When the video of the encounter went viral, the continuum of emotional reactions on social media rightfully spanned from moral outrage to sheer rage. The incident called to mind a painful history of false criminal accusations made against Black men by white women, which often ended with devastating consequences. It was appalling that the woman didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leash her dog\\xe2\\x80\\x94and her prejudice.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_182\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"182\"/>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a racist. I did not mean to harm that man in any way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the woman declared in her public apology. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I was just scared.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her simple explanation overlooks the complex emotions that fueled her actions. She could have stopped to ask why she had been afraid\\xe2\\x80\\x94what views about Black men had led her to feel threatened in a polite conversation? She could have paused to consider why she had felt entitled to lie to the police\\xe2\\x80\\x94what power dynamics had made her feel this was acceptable?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Her simple denial overlooks the complex reality that racism is a function of our actions, not merely our intentions. As historian Ibram X. Kendi writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText361\"/>Racist and antiracist are not fixed identities. We can be a racist one minute and an antiracist the next.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Humans, like polarizing issues, rarely come in binaries.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When asked whether he accepted her apology, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText362\"/>Christian Cooper refused to make a simple judgment, offering a nuanced assessment:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-first\">I think her apology is sincere. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure if in that apology she recognizes that while she may not be or consider herself a racist, that particular act was definitely racist.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract\">Granted, it was a stressful situation, a sudden situation, maybe a moment of spectacularly poor judgment, but she went there.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-last\">Is she a racist?

You might even be experiencing some complex emotions as you read this.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be up to the victim to inject complexity into a difficult conversation. Rethinking should start with the offender. If the woman had taken responsibility for reevaluating her beliefs and behaviors, she <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_183\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"183\"/>might have become an example to others who recognized a bit of themselves in her reaction. Although she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change what she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d already done, by recognizing the complex power dynamics that breed and perpetuate systemic racism, she might have spurred deeper discussions of the range of possible steps toward justice.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Charged conversations cry out for nuance. When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re preaching, prosecuting, or politicking, the complexity of reality can seem like an inconvenient truth. In scientist mode, it can be an invigorating truth\\xe2\\x80\\x94it means there are new opportunities for understanding and for <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_184\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"184\"/>progress.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

When she graduated from college, the last thing she wanted to do was teach. She was fascinated by history but bored by her social studies classes. Searching for a way to breathe life into overlooked objects and forgotten events, Erin started her career working in museums. Before long, she found herself writing a resource manual for teachers, leading school tours, and engaging students in interactive programs. She realized that the enthusiasm she saw on field trips was missing in too many classrooms, and she decided to do something about it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For the past eight years, Erin has taught social studies in the Milwaukee area. Her mission is to cultivate curiosity about the past, but also to motivate students to update their knowledge in the present. In 2020, she was named <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText364\"/>Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Teacher of the Year.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">One day, an eighth grader complained that the reading assignment <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_186\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"186\"/>from a history textbook was inaccurate. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a teacher, that kind of criticism could be a nightmare. Using an outdated textbook would be a sign that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know your material, and it would be embarrassing if your students noticed the error before you did.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">But Erin had assigned that particular reading intentionally. She collects old history books because she enjoys seeing how the stories we tell change over time, and she decided to give her students part of a textbook from 1940. Some of them just accepted the information it presented at face value. Through years of education, they had come to take it for granted that textbooks told the truth. Others were shocked by errors and omissions. It was ingrained in their minds that their readings were filled with incontrovertible facts. The lesson led them to start thinking like scientists and questioning what they were learning: whose story was included, whose was excluded, and what were they missing if only one or two perspectives were shared?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After opening her students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 eyes to the fact that knowledge can evolve, Erin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next step was to show them that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always evolving. To set up a unit on expansion in the West, she created her own textbook section describing what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like to be a middle-school student today. All the protagonists were women and girls, and all the generic pronouns were female. In the first year she introduced the material, a student raised his hand to point out that the boys were missing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one boy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Erin replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoys were around. They just weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing anything important.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was an aha moment for the student: he suddenly realized what it was like for an entire group to be marginalized for hundreds of years.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My favorite assignment of Erin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is her final one. As a passionate champion of inquiry-based learning, she sends her eighth graders off to do self-directed research in which they inspect, investigate, interrogate, and interpret. Their active learning culminates in a group project: they pick a chapter from their textbook, choosing a time period that interests them and a theme in history that they see as underrepresented. Then they go off to rewrite it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_187\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"187\"/>One group took on the civil rights chapter for failing to cover the original March on Washington, which was called off at the last minute in the early 1940s but inspired Martin Luther King Jr.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s historic march two decades later. Other groups revised the chapter on World War II to include the infantry regiments of Hispanic soldiers and second-generation Japanese soldiers who fought for the U.S. Army. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge light-bulb moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Erin told me.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_187\" src=\"../images/52_FrozenIpadCartoon.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not a teacher by profession, you probably have roles in which you spend time educating others\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether as a parent, a mentor, a friend, or a colleague. In fact, every time we try to help someone think again, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing a kind of education. Whether we do our instruction in a classroom or in a boardroom, in an office or at our kitchen table, there are ways to make rethinking central to what\\xe2\\x80\\x94and how\\xe2\\x80\\x94we teach.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">With so much emphasis placed on imparting knowledge and building confidence, many teachers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do enough to encourage students to question themselves and one another. To figure out what it takes to change that mindset, I tracked down some extraordinary educators who foster rethinking cycles by instilling intellectual humility, disseminating <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_188\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"188\"/>doubt, and cultivating curiosity. I also tested a few of my own ideas by turning my classroom into something of a living lab.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">LEARNING, INTERRUPTED</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Looking back on my own early education, one of my biggest disappointments is that I never got to fully experience the biggest upheavals in science. Long before it ever occurred to me to be curious about the cosmos, my teachers started demystifying it in kindergarten. I often wonder how I would have felt if I was a teenager when I first learned that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live on a static, flat disc, but on a spinning, moving sphere.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I hope I would have been stunned, and that disbelief would have quickly given way to curiosity and eventually the awe of discovery and the joy of being wrong. I also suspect it would have been a life-changing lesson in confident humility. <i class=\"calibre5\">If I could be that mistaken about what was under my own two feet, how many other so-called truths were actually question marks?</i> Sure, I knew that many earlier generations of humans had gotten it wrong, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge difference between learning about other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s false beliefs and actually learning to unbelieve things ourselves.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I realize this thought experiment is wildly impractical. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard enough to keep kids in the dark about Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy. Even if we could pull off such a delay, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a risk that some students would seize and freeze on what they learned early on. They could become trapped in an overconfidence cycle where pride in false knowledge fuels conviction, and confirmation and desirability biases lead to validation. Before you know it, we might have a whole nation of flat-earthers.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Evidence shows that if false scientific beliefs aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t addressed in elementary school, they become harder to change later. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLearning counterintuitive scientific ideas [is] akin to becoming a fluent speaker of a second language,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d psychologist Deborah Kelemen writes. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText365\"/>It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca task that <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_189\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"189\"/>becomes increasingly difficult the longer it is delayed, and one that is almost never achieved with only piecemeal instruction and infrequent practice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what kids really need: frequent practice at unlearning, especially when it comes to the mechanisms of how cause and effect work.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_189\" src=\"../images/ART_53_FlatEarthCycle.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In the field of history education, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a growing movement to ask questions that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText366\"/>don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a single right answer. In a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText367\"/>curriculum developed at Stanford, high school students are encouraged to critically examine what really caused the Spanish-American War, whether the New Deal was a success, and why the Montgomery bus boycott was a watershed moment. Some teachers <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText368\"/>even send students out to interview people with whom they disagree. The focus is less on being right, and more on building the skills to consider different views and argue productively about them.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean all interpretations are accepted as valid. When the son of a Holocaust survivor came to her class, Erin McCarthy told her students that some people denied the existence of the Holocaust, and <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_190\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"190\"/>taught them to examine the evidence and reject those false claims. This is part of a broader movement to teach kids to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText369\"/>think like fact-checkers: the guidelines include (1) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterrogate information instead of simply consuming it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2) \\xe2\\x80\\x9creject rank and popularity as a proxy for reliability,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and (3) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderstand that the sender of information is often not its source.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">These principles are valuable beyond the classroom. At our family dinner table, we sometimes hold myth-busting discussions. My wife and I have shared how we learned in school that Pluto was a planet (not true anymore) and Columbus discovered America (never true). Our kids have taught us that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText370\"/>King Tut probably didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t die in a chariot accident and gleefully explained that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText371\"/>when sloths do their version of a fart, the gas comes not from their behinds but from their mouths.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Rethinking needs to become a regular habit. Unfortunately, traditional methods of education don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always allow students to form that habit.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE DUMBSTRUCK EFFECT</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s week twelve of physics class, and you get to attend a couple of sessions with a new, highly rated instructor to learn about static equilibrium and fluids. The first session is on statics; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lecture. The second is on fluids, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an active-learning session. One of your roommates has a different, equally popular instructor who does the opposite\\xe2\\x80\\x94using active learning for statics and lecturing on fluids.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In both cases the content and the handouts are identical; the only difference is the delivery method. During the lecture the instructor presents slides, gives explanations, does demonstrations, and solves sample problems, and you take notes on the handouts. In the active-learning session, instead of doing the example problems himself, the instructor sends the class off to figure them out in small groups, wandering around to ask questions and offer tips before walking the class through the solution. At the end, you fill out a survey.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_191\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"191\"/>In this experiment the topic doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter: the teaching method is what shapes your experience. I expected active learning to win the day, but the data suggest that you and your roommate will both enjoy the subject more when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText372\"/>delivered by lecture. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also rate the instructor who lectures as more effective\\xe2\\x80\\x94and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be more likely to say you wish all your physics courses were taught that way.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Upon reflection, the appeal of dynamic lectures shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be surprising. For generations, people have admired the rhetorical eloquence of poets like Maya Angelou, politicians like John F. Kennedy Jr. and Ronald Reagan, preachers like Martin Luther King Jr., and teachers like Richard Feynman. Today we live in a golden age of spellbinding speaking, where great orators engage and educate from platforms with unprecedented reach. Creatives used to share their methods in small communities; now they can accumulate enough YouTube and Instagram subscribers to populate a small country. Pastors once gave sermons to hundreds at church; now they can reach hundreds of thousands over the internet in megachurches. Professors used to teach small enough classes that they could spend individual time with each student; now their lessons can be broadcast to millions through online courses.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear that these lectures are entertaining and informative. The question is whether they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the ideal method of teaching. In the physics experiment, the students took tests to gauge how much they had learned about statics and fluids. Despite enjoying the lectures more, they actually gained more knowledge and skill from the active-learning session. It required more mental effort, which made it less fun but led to deeper understanding.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For a long time, I believed that we learn more when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having fun. This research convinced me I was wrong. <i class=\"calibre5\">It also reminded me of my favorite physics teacher, who got stellar reviews for letting us play Ping-Pong in class, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite make the coefficient of friction stick.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Active learning has impact far beyond physics. A meta-analysis compared the effects of lecturing and active learning on students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_192\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"192\"/>mastery of the material, cumulating 225 studies with over 46,000 undergraduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Active-learning methods included group problem solving, worksheets, and tutorials. On average, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText373\"/>students scored half a letter grade worse under traditional lecturing than through active learning\\xe2\\x80\\x94and students were 1.55 times more likely to fail in classes with traditional lecturing. The researchers estimate that if the students who failed in lecture courses had participated in active learning, more than $3.5 million in tuition could have been saved.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not hard to see why a boring lecture would fail, but even captivating lectures can fall short for a less obvious, more concerning reason. Lectures aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t designed to accommodate dialogue or disagreement; they turn students into passive receivers of information rather than active thinkers. In the above meta-analysis, lecturing was especially ineffective in debunking known misconceptions\\xe2\\x80\\x94in leading students to think again. And experiments have shown that when a speaker delivers an inspiring message, the audience scrutinizes the material less carefully and forgets more of the content\\xe2\\x80\\x94even while claiming to remember more of it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Social scientists have called this phenomenon <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText374\"/>the awestruck effect, but I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better described as <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText375\"/>the dumbstruck effect. The sage-on-the-stage often preaches new thoughts, but rarely teaches us how to think for ourselves. Thoughtful lecturers might prosecute inaccurate arguments and tell us what to think instead, but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily show us how to rethink moving forward. Charismatic speakers can put us under a political spell, under which we follow them to gain their approval or affiliate with their tribe. We should be persuaded by the substance of an argument, not the shiny package in which it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrapped.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">To be clear, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not suggesting eliminating lectures altogether. I love watching TED talks and have even learned to enjoy giving them. It was attending brilliant lectures that first piqued my curiosity about becoming a teacher, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not opposed to doing some lecturing in my own <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_193\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"193\"/>classes. I just think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem that lectures remain the dominant method of teaching in secondary and higher education. <i class=\"calibre5\">Expect a lecture on that soon.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText376\"/>In North American universities, more than half of STEM professors spend at least 80 percent of their time lecturing, just over a quarter incorporate bits of interactivity, and fewer than a fifth use truly student-centered methods that involve active learning. In high schools it seems that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText377\"/>half of teachers lecture most or all of the time.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"47_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-028-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> Lectures are not always the best method of learning, and they are not enough to develop students into lifelong learners. If you spend all of your school years being fed information and are never given the opportunity to question it, you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t develop the tools for rethinking that you need in life.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_193\" src=\"../images/54_QuestionSpeechesCartoon.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\">Steve Macone/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank; \\xc2\\xa9 Cond\\xc3\\xa9 Nast</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_194\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"194\" class=\"calibre3\"/>THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF REPEATING</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only one class I regret missing in college. It was taught by a philosopher named Robert Nozick. One of his ideas became famous thanks to the movie <i class=\"calibre5\">The Matrix</i>: in the 1970s, Nozick introduced a thought experiment about whether people would choose to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText379\"/>enter an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexperience machine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that could provide infinite pleasure but remove them from real life.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"48_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-027-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> In his classroom, Nozick created his own version of an experience machine: he insisted on teaching a new class every year. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText380\"/>I do my thinking through the courses I give,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Nozick taught one course on truth; another on philosophy and neuroscience; a third on Socrates, Buddha, and Jesus; a fourth on thinking about thinking; and a fifth on the Russian Revolution. In four decades of teaching, he taught only one class a second time: it was on the good life. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText381\"/>Presenting a completely polished and worked-out view doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give students a feel for what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like to do original work in philosophy and to see it happen, to catch on to doing it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. Sadly, before I could take one of his courses, he died of cancer.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">What I found so inspiring about Nozick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach was that he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t content for students to learn from him. He wanted them to learn <i class=\"calibre5\">with</i> him. Every time he tackled a new topic, he would have the opportunity <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_195\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"195\"/>to rethink his existing views on it. He was a remarkable role model for changing up our familiar methods of teaching\\xe2\\x80\\x94and learning. When I started teaching, I wanted to adopt some of his principles. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prepared to inflict an entire semester of half-baked ideas on my students, so I set a benchmark: every year I would aim to throw out 20 percent of my class and replace it with new material. If I was doing new thinking every year, we could all start rethinking together.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">With the other 80 percent of the material, though, I found myself failing. I was teaching a semester-long class on organizational behavior for juniors and seniors. When I introduced evidence, I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t giving them the space to rethink it. After years of wrestling with this problem, it dawned on me that I could create a new assignment to teach rethinking. I assigned students to work in small groups to record their own mini-podcasts or mini\\xe2\\x80\\x93TED talks. Their charge was to question a popular practice, to champion an idea that went against the grain of conventional wisdom, or to challenge principles covered in class.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As they started working on the project, I noticed a surprising pattern. The students who struggled the most were the straight-A students\\xe2\\x80\\x94the perfectionists. It turns out that although <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText383\"/>perfectionists are more likely than their peers to ace school, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText384\"/>they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perform any better than their colleagues at work. This tracks with evidence that, across a wide range of industries, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText385\"/>grades are not a strong predictor of job performance.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText386\"/>Achieving excellence in school often requires mastering old ways of thinking. Building an influential career demands new ways of thinking. In a classic study of highly accomplished architects, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText387\"/>the most creative ones graduated with a B average. Their straight-A counterparts were so determined to be right that they often failed to take the risk of rethinking the orthodoxy. A similar pattern emerged in a study of students who graduated at the top of their class. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText388\"/>Valedictorians aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t likely to be the future\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visionaries,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d education researcher Karen <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_196\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"196\"/>Arnold explains. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey typically settle into the system instead of shaking it up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I saw with my straight-A students: they were terrified of being wrong. To give them a strong incentive to take some risks, I made the assignment worth 20 percent of their final grade. I had changed the rules: now they were being rewarded for rethinking instead of regurgitating. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure if that incentive would work until I reviewed the work of a trio of straight-A students. They gave their mini\\xe2\\x80\\x93TED talk about the problems with TED talks, pointing out the risks of reinforcing short attention spans and privileging superficial polish over deep insight. Their presentation was so thoughtful and entertaining that I played it for the entire class. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you have the courage to stand up to the trend towards glib, seamless answers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they deadpanned as we laughed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen stop watching this video right now, and do some real research, like we did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I made the assignment a staple of the course from then on. The following year I wanted to go further in rethinking the content and format of my class. In a typical three-hour class, I would spend no more than twenty to thirty minutes lecturing. The rest is active learning\\xe2\\x80\\x94students make decisions in simulations and negotiate in role-plays, and then we debrief, discuss, debate, and problem solve. My mistake was treating the syllabus as if it were a formal contract: once I finalized it in September, it was effectively set in stone. I decided it was time to change that and invite the students to rethink part of the structure of the class itself.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">On my next syllabus, I deliberately left one class session completely blank. Halfway through the semester, I invited the students to work in small groups to develop and pitch an idea for how we should spend that open day. Then they voted.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">One of the most popular ideas came from Lauren McCann, who suggested a creative step toward helping students recognize that rethinking was a useful skill\\xe2\\x80\\x94and one they had already been using in college. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_197\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"197\"/>She invited her classmates to write letters to their freshmen selves covering what they wish they had known back then. The students encouraged their younger selves to stay open to different majors, instead of declaring the first one that erased their uncertainty. To be less obsessed with grades, and more focused on relationships. To explore different career possibilities, rather than committing too soon to the one that promised the most pay or prestige.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Lauren collected letters from dozens of students to launch a website, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText389\"/>Dear Penn Freshmen. Within twenty-four hours, dearpennfresh.com had over ten thousand visits, and a half dozen schools were starting their own versions to help students rethink their academic, social, and professional choices.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This practice can extend far beyond the classroom. As we approach any life transition\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a first job, a second marriage, or a third child\\xe2\\x80\\x94we can pause to ask people what they wish they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d known before they went through that experience. Once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the other side of it, we can share what we ourselves should have rethought.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been demonstrated repeatedly that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText390\"/>one of the best ways to learn is to teach. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until I let my students design a day of class that I truly understood how much they had to teach one another\\xe2\\x80\\x94<i class=\"calibre5\">and</i> me. They were rethinking not just what they learned, but whom they could learn from.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The following year, the class\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favorite idea took that rethinking a step further: the students hosted a day of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpassion talks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on which anyone could teach the class about something he or she loved. We learned how to beatbox and design buildings that mesh with nature and make the world more allergy safe. From that point on, sharing passions has been part of class participation. All the students give a passion talk as a way of introducing themselves to their peers. Year after year, they tell me that it injects a heightened level of curiosity into the room, leaving them eager to soak up insights from each of their classmates.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_198\" src=\"../images/55_WritingRewritingCartoon.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\"><a href=\"http://www.CartoonCollections.com\" class=\"calibre2\">www.CartoonCollections.com</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_198\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"198\" class=\"calibre3\"/>JACK OF ROUGH DRAFTS, MASTER OF CRAFTS</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">When I asked a handful of education pioneers to name the best teacher of rethinking they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever encountered, I kept hearing the same name: Ron Berger. If you invited Ron over for dinner, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of person who would notice that one of your chairs was broken, ask if you had some tools handy, and fix it on the spot.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For most of his career, Ron was a public-elementary-school teacher in rural Massachusetts. His nurse, his plumber, and his local firefighters were all former students. During the summers and on weekends, he worked as a carpenter. Ron has devoted his life to teaching students <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText391\"/>an ethic of excellence. Mastering a craft, in his experience, is about constantly revising our thinking. Hands-on craftsmanship is the foundation for his classroom philosophy.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ron wanted his students to experience the joy of discovery, so he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start by teaching them established knowledge. He began the school <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_199\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"199\"/>year by presenting them with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrapples\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94problems to work through in phases. The approach was think-pair-share: the kids started individually, updated their ideas in small groups, and then presented their thoughts to the rest of the class, arriving at solutions together. Instead of introducing existing taxonomies of animals, for example, Ron had them develop their own categories first. Some students classified animals by whether they walked on land, swam in water, or flew through the air; others arranged them according to color, size, or diet. The lesson was that scientists always have many options, and their frameworks are useful in some ways but arbitrary in others.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When students confront complex problems, they often feel confused. A teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural impulse is to rescue them as quickly as possible so they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel lost or incompetent. Yet psychologists find that one of the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText392\"/>hallmarks of an open mind is responding to confusion with curiosity and interest. One student put it eloquently: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText393\"/>I need time for my confusion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText394\"/>Confusion can be a cue that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new territory to be explored or a fresh puzzle to be solved.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ron wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t content to deliver lessons that erased confusion. He wanted students to embrace confusion. His vision was for them to become leaders of their own learning, much like they would in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo it yourself\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (DIY) craft projects. He started encouraging students to think like young scientists: they would identify problems, develop hypotheses, and design their own experiments to test them. His sixth graders went around the community to test local homes for radon gas. His third graders created their own maps of amphibian habitats. His first graders got their own group of snails to take care of, and went on to test which of over 140 foods they liked\\xe2\\x80\\x94and whether they preferred hot or cold, dark or light, and wet or dry environments.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For architecture and engineering lessons, Ron had his students create blueprints for a house. When he required them to do at least four different drafts, other teachers warned him that younger students would become discouraged. Ron disagreed\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had already tested the concept <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_200\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"200\"/>with kindergarteners and first graders in art. Rather than asking them to simply draw a house, he announced, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be doing four different <i class=\"calibre5\">versions</i> of a drawing of a house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Some students didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop there; many wound up deciding to do eight or ten drafts. The students had a support network of classmates cheering them on in their efforts. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuality means rethinking, reworking, and polishing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ron reflects. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey need to feel they will be celebrated, not ridiculed, for going back to the drawing board.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. They soon began complaining if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow them to do more than one version.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ron wanted to teach his students to revise their thinking based on input from others, so he turned the classroom into a challenge network. Every week\\xe2\\x80\\x94and sometimes every day\\xe2\\x80\\x94the entire class would do a critique session. One format was a gallery critique: Ron put everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work on display, sent students around the room to observe, and then facilitated a discussion of what they saw as excellent and why. This method wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used only for art and science projects; for a writing assignment, they would evaluate a sentence or a paragraph. The other format was an in-depth critique: for a single session, the class would focus on the work of one student or group. The authors would explain their goals and where they needed help, and Ron guided the class through a discussion of strengths and areas for development. He encouraged students to be specific and kind: to critique the work rather than the author. He taught them to avoid preaching and prosecuting: since they were sharing their subjective opinions, not objective assessments, they should say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He invited them to show humility and curiosity, framing their suggestions in terms of questions like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to hear why\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you considered\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The class didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just critique projects. Each day they would discuss what excellence looked like. With each new project they updated their criteria. Along with rethinking their own work, they were learning to continually rethink their standards. To help them further evolve those standards, Ron regularly brought in outside experts. Local architects and scientists would come in to offer their own critiques, and the class would incorporate their principles and vocabularies into future discussions. Long after they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d moved on to middle and high school, it was not uncommon for former students to visit Ron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s class and ask for a critique of their work.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_201\" src=\"../images/ART_56_JudgingYourselfWork.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_201\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"201\"/>As soon as I connected with Ron Berger, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help but wish I had been able to take one of his classes. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t because I had suffered from a lack of exceptional teachers. It was because I had never had the privilege of being in a classroom with a culture like his, with a whole room of students dedicated to questioning themselves and one another.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ron now spends his days speaking, writing, teaching a course for teachers at Harvard, and consulting with schools. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the chief academic officer of EL Education, an organization dedicated to reimagining how teaching and learning take place in schools. Ron and his colleagues work directly with 150 schools and develop curricula that have reached millions of students.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At one of their schools in Idaho, a student named Austin was assigned to make a <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText395\"/>scientifically accurate drawing of a butterfly. This is his first draft:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w25c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_202_0\" src=\"../images/57_AustinButterfly1_Page_1.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_202\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"202\"/>Austin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s classmates formed a critique group. They gave him two rounds of suggestions for changing the shape of the wings, and he produced his second and third drafts. The critique group pointed out that the wings were uneven and that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d become round again. Austin wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t discouraged. On his next revision, the group encouraged him to fill in the pattern on the wings.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_202\" src=\"../images/page_195.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For the final draft, Austin was ready to color it in. When Ron showed the completed drawing to a roomful of elementary school students in Maine, they gasped in awe at his progress and his final product.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w45c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_202_5\" src=\"../images/59_AustinButterfly1_Page_6.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_203\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"203\"/>I gasped, too, because Austin made these drawings when he was in first grade.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Seeing a six-year-old undergo that kind of metamorphosis made me think again about how quickly children can become comfortable rethinking and revising. Ever since, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve encouraged our kids to do multiple drafts of their own drawings. As excited as they were to see their first draft hanging on the wall, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re that much prouder of their fourth version.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Few of us will have the good fortune to learn to draw a butterfly with Ron Berger or rewrite a textbook with Erin McCarthy. Yet all of us have the opportunity to teach more like them. Whomever we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re educating, we can express more humility, exude more curiosity, and introduce the children in our lives to the infectious joy of discovery.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I believe that good teachers introduce new thoughts, but great teachers introduce new ways of thinking. Collecting a teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge may help us solve the challenges of the day, but understanding how a teacher thinks can help us navigate the challenges of a lifetime. Ultimately, education is more than the information we accumulate in our heads. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the habits we develop as we keep revising our drafts and the skills we build to keep <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_204\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"204\"/>learning.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

He just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize it could happen in outer space.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Luca had just become the youngest astronaut ever to take a long trip to the International Space Station. In July 2013, the thirty-six-year-old Italian astronaut completed his first spacewalk, spending six hours running experiments, moving equipment, and setting up power and data cables. Now, a week later, Luca and another astronaut, Chris Cassidy, were heading out for a second walk to continue their work and do some maintenance. As they prepared to leave the airlock, they could see the Earth 250 miles below.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After forty-four minutes in space, Luca felt something strange: the back of his head seemed to be wet. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure where the water was coming from. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a nuisance; it could cut off communication <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_206\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"206\"/>by shorting out his microphone or earphones. He reported the problem to Mission Control in Houston, and Chris asked if he was sweating. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sweating,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Luca said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it feels like a lot of water. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going anywhere, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just in my Snoopy cap. Just FYI.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He went back to work.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The officer in charge of spacewalks, Karina Eversley, knew something was wrong. <i class=\"calibre5\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not normal</i>, she thought, and quickly recruited a team of experts to compile questions for Luca. Was the amount of liquid increasing? Luca couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell. Was he sure it was water? When he stuck out his tongue to capture a few of the drops that were floating in his helmet, the taste was metallic.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Mission Control made the call to terminate the spacewalk early. Luca and Chris had to split up to follow their tethers, which were routed in opposite directions. To get around an antenna, Luca flipped over. Suddenly, he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see clearly or breathe through his nose\\xe2\\x80\\x94globs of water were covering his eyes and filling his nostrils. The water was continuing to accumulate, and if it reached his mouth he could drown. His only hope was to navigate quickly back to the airlock. As the sun set, Luca was surrounded by darkness, with only a small headlight to guide him. Then his comms went down, too\\xe2\\x80\\x94he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear himself or anyone else speak.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Luca managed to find his way back to the outer hatch of the airlock, using his memory and the tension in his tether. He was still in grave danger: before he could remove his helmet, he would have to wait for Chris to close the hatch and repressurize the airlock. For several agonizing minutes of silence, it was unclear whether he would survive. When it was finally safe to remove his helmet, a quart and a half of water was in it, but Luca was alive. Months later, the incident would be called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText397\"/>scariest wardrobe malfunction in NASA history.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The technical updates followed swiftly. The spacesuit engineers traced the leak to a fan/pump/separator, which they replaced moving forward. They also added a breathing tube that works like a snorkel and a pad to absorb water inside the helmet. Yet the biggest error wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t technical\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was human.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_207\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"207\"/>When Luca had returned from his first spacewalk a week earlier, he had noticed some droplets of water in his helmet. He and Chris assumed they were the result of a leak in the bag that provided drinking water in his suit, and the crew in Houston agreed. Just to be safe, they replaced the bag, but that was the end of the discussion.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The space station chief engineer, Chris Hansen, led the eventual investigation into what had gone wrong with Luca\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe occurrence of minor amounts of water in the helmet was normalized,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chris told me. In the space station community, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperception was that drink bags leak, which led to an acceptance that it was a likely explanation without digging deeper into it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Luca\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scare wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the first time that NASA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure at rethinking had proven disastrous. In 1986, the space shuttle <i class=\"calibre5\">Challenger</i> exploded after a catastrophically shallow analysis of the risk that circular gaskets called O-rings could fail. Although this had been identified as a launch constraint, NASA had a track record of overriding it in prior missions without any problems occurring. On an unusually cold launch day, the O-ring sealing the rocket booster joints ruptured, allowing hot gas to burn through the fuel tank, killing all seven <i class=\"calibre5\">Challenger</i> astronauts.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In 2003, the space shuttle <i class=\"calibre5\">Columbia</i> disintegrated under similar circumstances. After takeoff, the team on the ground noticed that some foam had fallen from the ship, but most of them assumed it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a major issue since it had happened in past missions without incident. They failed to rethink that assumption and instead started discussing what repairs would be done to the ship to reduce the turnaround time for the next mission. The foam loss was, in fact, a critical issue: the damage it caused to the wing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading edge let hot gas leak into the shuttle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wing upon reentry into the atmosphere. Once again, all seven astronauts lost their lives.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Rethinking is not just an individual skill. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a collective capability, and it depends heavily on an organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture. NASA had long been a prime example of a performance culture: excellence of execution was <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_208\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"208\"/>the paramount value. Although NASA accomplished extraordinary things, they soon became victims of overconfidence cycles. As people took pride in their standard operating procedures, gained conviction in their routines, and saw their decisions validated through their results, they missed opportunities for rethinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Rethinking is more likely to happen in a learning culture, where growth is the core value and rethinking cycles are routine. In learning cultures, the norm is for people to know what they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, doubt their existing practices, and stay curious about new routines to try out. Evidence shows that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText398\"/>in learning cultures, organizations innovate more and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText399\"/>make fewer mistakes. After studying and advising change initiatives at NASA and the Gates Foundation, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that learning cultures thrive under a particular combination of psychological safety and accountability.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">I ERR, THEREFORE I LEARN</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">Years ago, an engineer turned management professor named Amy Edmondson became interested in preventing medical errors. She went into a hospital and surveyed its staff about the degree of psychological safety they experienced in their teams\\xe2\\x80\\x94could they take risks without the fear of being punished? Then she collected data on the number of medical errors each team made, tracking serious outcomes like potentially fatal doses of the wrong medication. She was surprised to find that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText400\"/>the more psychological safety a team felt, the higher its error rates.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It appeared that psychological safety could breed complacency. When trust runs deep in a team, people might not feel the need to question their colleagues or double-check their own work.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">But Edmondson soon recognized a major limitation of the data: the errors were all self-reported. To get an unbiased measure of mistakes, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_209\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"209\"/>she sent a covert observer into the units. When she analyzed those data, the results flipped: psychologically safe teams <i class=\"calibre5\">reported</i> more errors, but they actually <i class=\"calibre5\">made</i> fewer errors. By freely admitting their mistakes, they were then able to learn what had caused them and eliminate them moving forward. In psychologically unsafe teams, people hid their mishaps to avoid penalties, which made it difficult for anyone to diagnose the root causes and prevent future problems. They kept repeating the same mistakes.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Since then, research on psychological safety has flourished. When I was involved in a study at Google to identify the factors that distinguish teams with high performance and well-being, the most important differentiator wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t who was on the team or even how meaningful their work was. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText401\"/>What mattered most was psychological safety.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Over the past few years, psychological safety has become a buzzword in many workplaces. Although leaders might understand its significance, they often misunderstand exactly what it is and how to create it. Edmondson is quick to point out that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText402\"/>psychological safety is not a matter of relaxing standards, making people comfortable, being nice and agreeable, or giving unconditional praise. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fostering a climate of respect, trust, and openness in which people can raise concerns and suggestions without fear of reprisal. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText403\"/>foundation of a learning culture.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In performance cultures, the emphasis on results often undermines psychological safety. When we see people get punished for failures and mistakes, we become worried about proving our competence and protecting our careers. We learn to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText404\"/>engage in self-limiting behavior, biting our tongues rather than voicing questions and concerns. Sometimes that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s due to power distance: we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re afraid of challenging the big boss at the top. The pressure to conform to authority is real, and those who dare to deviate run the risk of backlash. In performance cultures, we also censor ourselves in the presence of experts who seem to know all the answers\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially if we lack confidence in our own expertise.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_210\" src=\"../images/ART_60_PsychologicalSafety.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_210\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"210\"/>A lack of psychological safety was a persistent problem at NASA. Before the <i class=\"calibre5\">Challenger</i> launch, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText405\"/>some engineers did raise red flags but were silenced by managers; others were ignored and ended up silencing themselves. After the <i class=\"calibre5\">Columbia</i> launch, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText406\"/>an engineer asked for clearer photographs to inspect the damage to the wing, but managers didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supply them. In a critical meeting to evaluate the condition of the shuttle after takeoff, the engineer didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak up.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">About a month before that <i class=\"calibre5\">Columbia</i> launch, Ellen Ochoa became the deputy director of flight crew operations. In 1993, Ellen had made history by becoming the first Latina in space. Now, the first flight she supported in a management role had ended in tragedy. After breaking the news to the space station crew and consoling the family members of the fallen astronauts, she was determined to figure out how she could personally help to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText407\"/>prevent this kind of disaster from ever happening again.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ellen recognized that at NASA, the performance culture was eroding psychological safety. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople pride themselves on their engineering expertise and excellence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey fear their expertise will be questioned in a way that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s embarrassing to them. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that basic fear of looking like a fool, asking questions that people just dismiss, or being <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_211\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"211\"/>told you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To combat that problem and nudge the culture toward learning, she started carrying a 3 \\xc3\\x97 5 note card in her pocket with questions to ask about every launch and important operational decision. Her list included:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul class=\"calibre7\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first1\">What leads you to that assumption? Why do you think it is correct? What might happen if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li class=\"x07-list-bulleted\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first1\">What are the uncertainties in your analysis?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<li class=\"x07-list-bulleted-last\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-bulleted-first1\">I understand the advantages of your recommendation. What are the disadvantages?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A decade later, though, the same lessons about rethinking would have to be relearned in the context of spacewalk suits. As flight controllers first became aware of the droplets of water in Luca Parmitano\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helmet, they made two faulty assumptions: the cause was the drink bag, and the effect was inconsequential. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until the second spacewalk, when Luca was in actual danger, that they started to question whether those assumptions were wrong.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When engineer Chris Hansen took over as the manager of the extravehicular activity office, he inaugurated a norm of posing questions like Ellen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll anybody would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had to ask is, \\xe2\\x80\\x98<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText408\"/>How do you know the drink bag leaked?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The answer would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Because somebody told us.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That response would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve set off red flags. It would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken ten minutes to check, but nobody asked. It was the same for <i class=\"calibre5\">Columbia</i>. Boeing came in and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This foam, we think we know what it did.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 If somebody had asked how they knew, nobody could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve answered that question.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><i class=\"calibre5\">How do you know?</i> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a question we need to ask more often, both of ourselves and of others. The power lies in its frankness. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nonjudgmental\\xe2\\x80\\x94a straightforward expression of doubt and curiosity that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put people on the defensive. Ellen Ochoa wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afraid to ask that question, but she was an astronaut with a doctorate in engineering, serving in a senior leadership role. For too many people in too many workplaces, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_212\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"212\"/>the question feels like a bridge too far. Creating psychological safety is easier said than done, so I set out to learn about how leaders can establish it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">SAFE AT HOME GATES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">When I first arrived at the Gates Foundation, people were whispering about the annual strategy reviews. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the time when program teams across the foundation meet with the cochairs\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bill and Melinda Gates\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the CEO to give progress reports on execution and collect feedback. Although the foundation employs some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading experts in areas ranging from eradicating disease to promoting educational equity, these experts are often intimidated by Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge base, which seems impossibly broad and deep. What if he spots a fatal flaw in my work? Will it be the end of my career here?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years ago, leaders at the Gates Foundation reached out to see if I could help them build psychological safety. They were worried that the pressure to present airtight analyses was discouraging people from taking risks. They often stuck to tried-and-true strategies that would make incremental progress rather than daring to undertake bold experiments that might make a bigger dent in some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most vexing problems.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The existing evidence on creating psychological safety gave us some starting points. I knew that changing the culture of an entire organization is daunting, while changing the culture of a team is more feasible. It starts with modeling the values we want to promote, identifying and praising others who exemplify them, and building a coalition of colleagues who are committed to making the change.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The standard advice for managers on building psychological safety is to model openness and inclusiveness. Ask for feedback on how you can improve, and people will feel safe to take risks. To test whether that <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_213\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"213\"/>recommendation would work, I launched an experiment with a doctoral student, Constantinos Coutifaris. In multiple companies, we randomly assigned some managers to ask their teams for constructive criticism. Over the following week, their teams reported higher psychological safety, but as we anticipated, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t last. Some managers who asked for feedback didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like what they heard and got defensive. Others found the feedback useless or felt helpless to act on it, which discouraged them from continuing to seek feedback and their teams from continuing to offer it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Another group of managers took a different approach, one that had less immediate impact in the first week but led to sustainable <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText409\"/>gains in psychological safety a full year later. Instead of asking them to seek feedback, we had randomly assigned those managers to share their past experiences with receiving feedback and their future development goals. We advised them to tell their teams about a time when they benefited from constructive criticism and to identify the areas that they were working to improve now.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">By admitting some of their imperfections out loud, managers demonstrated that they could take it\\xe2\\x80\\x94and made a public commitment to remain open to feedback. They normalized vulnerability, making their teams more comfortable opening up about their own struggles. Their employees gave more useful feedback because they knew where their managers were working to grow. That motivated managers to create practices to keep the door open: they started holding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cask me anything\\xe2\\x80\\x9d coffee chats, opening weekly one-on-one meetings by asking for constructive criticism, and setting up monthly team sessions where everyone shared their development goals and progress.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Creating psychological safety can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be an isolated episode or a task to check off on a to-do list. When discussing their weaknesses, many of the managers in our experiment felt awkward and anxious at first. Many of their team members were surprised by that vulnerability and unsure of how to respond. Some were skeptical: they thought their managers <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_214\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"214\"/>might be fishing for compliments or cherry-picking comments that made them look good. It was only over time\\xe2\\x80\\x94as managers repeatedly demonstrated humility and curiosity\\xe2\\x80\\x94that the dynamic changed.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At the Gates Foundation, I wanted to go a step further. Instead of just having managers open up with their own teams about how they had previously been criticized, I wondered what would happen if senior leaders shared their experiences across the entire organization. It dawned on me that I had a memorable way to make that happen.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few years earlier, our MBA students at Wharton decided to create a video for their annual comedy show. It was inspired by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMean Tweets,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the late-night segment on <i class=\"calibre5\">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> in which celebrities read cruel tweets about themselves out loud. Our version was Mean Reviews, where faculty members read <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText410\"/>harsh comments from student course evaluations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is possibly the worst class I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever taken in my life<i class=\"calibre5\">,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</i> one professor read, looking defeated before saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFair enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Another read, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis professor is a b*tch. But she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice b*tch,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding with chagrin: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sweet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One of my own was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou remind me of a Muppet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The kicker belonged to a junior faculty member: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProf acts all down with pop culture, but secretly thinks Ariana Grande is a font in Microsoft Word.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I made it a habit to show that video in class every fall, and afterward the floodgates would open. Students seemed to be more comfortable sharing their criticisms and suggestions for improvement after seeing that although I take my work seriously, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take myself too seriously.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I sent the video to Melinda Gates, asking if she thought something similar might help with psychological safety in her organization. She not only said yes; she challenged the entire executive leadership team to participate and volunteered to be the first to take the hot seat. Her team compiled criticisms from staff surveys, printed them on note cards, and had her react in real time in front of a camera. She read one employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint that she was like Mary F***ing Poppins\\xe2\\x80\\x94the first time anyone could remember hearing Melinda curse\\xe2\\x80\\x94and explained how she was working on making her imperfections more visible.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_215\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"215\"/>To test the impact of her presentation, we randomly assigned one group of employees to watch Melinda engage with the tough comments, a second to watch a video of her talking about the culture she wanted to create in more general terms, and a third to serve as a pure control group. The first group came away with a stronger learning orientation\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were inspired to recognize their shortcomings and work to overcome them. Some of the power distance evaporated\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were more likely to reach out to Melinda and other senior leaders with both criticism and compliments. One employee commented:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-1p\">In that video Melinda did something that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not yet seen happen at the foundation: she broke through the veneer. It happened for me when she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI go into so many meetings where there are things I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I had to write that down because I was shocked and grateful at her honesty. Later, when she laughed, like really belly-laughed, and then answered the hard comments, the veneer came off again and I saw that she was no less of Melinda Gates, but actually, a whole lot more of Melinda Gates.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It takes confident humility to admit that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a work in progress. It shows that we care more about improving ourselves than proving ourselves.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"49_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-029-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> If that mindset spreads far enough within an organization, it can give people the freedom and courage to speak up.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">But mindsets aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough to transform a culture. Although psychological safety erases the fear of challenging authority, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily motivate us to question authority in the first place. To build a <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_216\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"216\"/>learning culture, we also need to create a specific kind of accountability\\xe2\\x80\\x94one that leads people to think again about the best practices in their workplaces.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_216\" src=\"../images/61_QuestionAuthority.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">THE WORST THING ABOUT BEST PRACTICES</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">In performance cultures, people often become attached to best practices. The risk is that once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve declared a routine the best, it becomes frozen in time. We preach about its virtues and stop questioning its vices, no longer curious about where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imperfect and where it could improve. Organizational learning should be an ongoing activity, but best practices imply it has reached an endpoint. We might be better off looking for better practices.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At NASA, although teams routinely debriefed after both training simulations and significant operational events, what sometimes stood in the way of exploring better practices was a performance culture that held people accountable for <i class=\"calibre5\">outcomes</i>. Every time they delayed a scheduled launch, they faced widespread public criticism and threats to funding. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_217\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"217\"/>Each time they celebrated a flight that made it into orbit, they were encouraging their engineers to focus on the fact that the launch resulted in a success rather than on the faulty processes that could jeopardize future launches. That left NASA rewarding luck and repeating problematic practices, failing to rethink what qualified as an acceptable risk. <i class=\"calibre5\">It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for a lack of ability. After all, these were rocket scientists.</i> As Ellen Ochoa observes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you are dealing with people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives hanging in the balance, you rely on following the procedures you already have. This can be the best approach in a time-critical situation, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problematic if it prevents a thorough assessment in the aftermath.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText413\"/>Focusing on results might be good for short-term performance, but it can be an obstacle to long-term learning. Sure enough, social scientists find that when people are held accountable only for whether the outcome was a success or failure, they are more likely to continue with ill-fated courses of action. Exclusively praising and rewarding results is dangerous because it breeds overconfidence in poor strategies, incentivizing people to keep doing things the way they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always done them. It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until a high-stakes decision goes horribly wrong that people pause to reexamine their practices.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to wait until a space shuttle explodes or an astronaut nearly drowns to determine whether a decision was successful. Along with outcome accountability, we can create process accountability by evaluating how carefully different options are considered as people make decisions. A bad decision process is based on shallow thinking. A good process is grounded in deep thinking and rethinking, enabling people to form and express independent opinions. Research shows that when we have to explain the procedures behind our decisions in real time, we think more critically and process the possibilities more thoroughly.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Process accountability might sound like the opposite of psychological safety, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually independent. Amy Edmondson finds that when psychological safety exists without accountability, people tend to stay within their comfort zone, and when there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accountability but not <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_218\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"218\"/>safety, people tend to stay silent in an anxiety zone. When we combine the two, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText414\"/>we create a learning zone. People feel free to experiment\\xe2\\x80\\x94and to poke holes in one another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiments in service of making them better. They become a challenge network.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">One of the most effective steps toward process accountability that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen is at Amazon, where important decisions aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t made based on simple PowerPoint presentations. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re informed by a six-page memo that lays out a problem, the different approaches that have been considered in the past, and how the proposed solutions serve the customer. At the start of the meeting, to avoid groupthink, everyone reads the memo silently. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t practical in every situation, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paramount when choices are both consequential and irreversible. Long before the results of the decision are known, the quality of the process can be evaluated based on the rigor and creativity of the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thinking in the memo and in the thoroughness of the discussion that ensues in the meeting.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In learning cultures, people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop keeping score. They expand the scorecard to consider processes as well as outcomes:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_218\" src=\"../images/ART_62_RethinkingScorecard.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_219\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"219\"/>Even if the outcome of a decision is positive, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily qualify as a success. If the process was shallow, you were lucky. If the decision process was deep, you can count it as an improvement: you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve discovered a better practice. If the outcome is negative, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a failure only if the decision process was shallow. If the result was negative but you evaluated the decision thoroughly, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve run a smart experiment.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The ideal time to run those experiments is when decisions are relatively inconsequential or reversible. In too many organizations, leaders look for guarantees that the results will be favorable before testing or investing in something new. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the equivalent of telling Gutenberg you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d only bankroll his printing press once he had a long line of satisfied customers\\xe2\\x80\\x94or announcing to a group of HIV researchers that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d only fund their clinical trials after their treatments worked.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Requiring proof is an enemy of progress. This is why companies like Amazon use a principle of disagree and commit. As Jeff Bezos explained it in an annual shareholder letter, instead of demanding convincing results, experiments start with asking people to make bets. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook, I know we disagree on this but <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText415\"/>will you gamble with me on it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The goal in a learning culture is to welcome these kinds of experiments, to make rethinking so familiar that it becomes routine.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Process accountability isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a matter of rewards and punishments. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also about who has decision authority. In <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText416\"/>a study of California banks, executives often kept approving additional loans to customers who\\xe2\\x80\\x99d already defaulted on a previous one. Since the bankers had signed off on the first loan, they were motivated to justify their initial decision. Interestingly, banks were more likely to identify and write off problem loans when they had high rates of executive turnover. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not the person who greenlit the initial loan, you have every incentive to rethink the previous assessment of that customer. <i class=\"calibre5\">If they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve defaulted on the past nineteen loans, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably time to adjust.</i> Rethinking is more likely when we separate the initial decision makers from the later decision evaluators.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_220\" src=\"../images/63_ReasonsForFailure.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\">\\xc2\\xa9 Hayley Lewis, Sketchnote summary of<i class=\"calibre5\"> A Spectrum of Reasons for Failure.</i> Illustration drawn May 2020.

Ellen Ochoa recalls that traditionally \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe same managers who were responsible for cost and schedule were the ones who also had the authority to waive technical requirements. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to talk yourself into something on a launch day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The <i class=\"calibre5\">Columbia</i> disaster reinforced the need for NASA to develop a stronger learning culture. On the next space shuttle flight, a problem surfaced with the sensors in an external engine tank. It reoccurred several more times over the next year and a half, but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t create any observable problems. In 2006, on the day of a countdown in Houston, the whole mission management team held a vote. There was overwhelming consensus that the launch should go forward. Only one outlier had voted no: Ellen Ochoa.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_221\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"221\"/>In the old performance culture, Ellen might\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been afraid to vote against the launch. In the emerging learning culture, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re encouraged to speak up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our responsibility to speak up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she explains. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInclusion at NASA is not only a way to increase innovation and engage employees; it directly affects safety since people need to feel valued and respected in order to be comfortable speaking up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In the past, the onus would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been on her to prove it was <i class=\"calibre5\">not</i> safe to launch. Now the onus was on the team to prove it <i class=\"calibre5\">was</i> safe to launch. That meant approaching their expertise with more humility, their decision with more doubt, and their analysis with more curiosity about the causes and potential consequences of the problem.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">After the vote, Ellen received a call from the NASA administrator in Florida, who expressed surprising interest in rethinking the majority opinion in the room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to understand your thinking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told her. They went on to delay the launch. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome people weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happy we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t launch that day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ellen reflects. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut people did not come up to me and berate me in any way or make me feel bad. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take it out on me personally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The following day all the sensors worked properly, but NASA ended up delaying three more launches over the next few months due to intermittent sensor malfunctions. At that point, the manager of the shuttle program called for the team to stand down until they identified the root cause. Eventually they figured out that the sensors were working fine; it was the cryogenic environment that was causing a faulty connection between the sensors and computers.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ellen became the deputy director and then the director of the Johnson Space Center, and NASA went on to execute nineteen consecutive successful space shuttle missions before retiring the program. In 2018, when Ellen retired from NASA, a senior leader approached her to tell her how her vote to delay the launch in 2006 had affected him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never said anything to you twelve years ago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit made me rethink how I approached launch days and whether I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing the right thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_222\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"222\"/>We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run experiments in the past; we can only imagine the counterfactual in the present. We can wonder whether the lives of fourteen astronauts would have been saved if NASA had gone back to rethink the risks of O-ring failures and foam loss before it was too late. We can wonder why those events didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make them as careful in reevaluating problems with spacesuits as they had become with space shuttles. In cultures of learning, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not weighed down with as many of these questions\\xe2\\x80\\x94which means we can live with fewer regrets.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

I thought getting a job might help. It turns out I have a lot of relatives in Hell, and, using connections, I became the assistant to a demon who pulls people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teeth out. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually a job, more of an internship. But I was eager. And at first it was kind of interesting. After a while, though, you start asking yourself: Is this what I came to Hell for, to hand different kinds of pliers to a demon?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-chapter-epigraph-source\">\\xe2\\x80\\x94Jack Handey</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"pcalibre x03-co-body-text\"><i class=\"calibre5\">W</i><i class=\"calibre5\">hat do you want to be when you grow up?</i> As a kid, that was my least favorite question. I dreaded conversations with adults because they always asked it\\xe2\\x80\\x94and no matter how I replied, they never liked my answer. When I said I wanted to be a superhero, they laughed. My next goal was to make the NBA, but despite countless hours of shooting hoops on my driveway, I was cut from middle school basketball tryouts three years in a row. I was clearly aiming too high.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In high school, I became obsessed with springboard diving and <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_226\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"226\"/>decided I wanted to become a diving coach. Adults scoffed at that plan: they told me I was aiming too low. In my first semester of college, I decided to major in psychology, but that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t open any doors\\xe2\\x80\\x94it just gave me a few to close. I knew I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be a therapist (not patient enough) or a psychiatrist (too squeamish for med school). I was still aimless, and I envied people who had a clear career plan.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">From the time he was in kindergarten, my cousin Ryan knew exactly what he wanted to be when he grew up. Becoming a doctor wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just the American dream\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was the family dream. Our great-grandparents emigrated from Russia and barely scraped by. Our grandmother was a secretary, and our grandfather worked in a factory, but it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough to support five children, so he worked a second job delivering milk. Before his kids were teenagers, he had taught them to drive the milk truck so they could finish their 4:00 a.m. delivery cycle before the school day and workday started. When none of their children went on to med school (or milk delivery), my grandparents hoped our generation would bring the prestige of a Dr. Grant to the family.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The first seven grandchildren didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t become doctors. I was the eighth, and I worked multiple jobs to pay for college and to keep my options open. They were proud when I ended up getting my doctorate in psychology, but they still hoped for a <i class=\"calibre5\">real</i> doctor. For the ninth grandchild, Ryan, who arrived four years after me, an M.D. was practically preordained.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ryan checked all the right boxes: along with being precocious, he had a strong work ethic. He set his sights on becoming a neurosurgeon. He was passionate about the potential to help people and ready to persist in the face of whatever obstacles would come into his path.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When Ryan was looking at colleges, he came to visit me. As we started talking about majors, he expressed a flicker of doubt about the premed track and asked if he should study economics instead. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a term in psychology that captures Ryan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personality: blirtatiousness. <i class=\"calibre5\">Yep, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an actual research concept, derived from <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText418\"/>the combination of blurting and flirting.</i> When \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblirters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meet people, their responses tend to be fast <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_227\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"227\"/>and effusive. They typically score high in extraversion and impulsiveness\\xe2\\x80\\x94and low in shyness and neuroticism. Ryan could push himself to study for long hours, but it drained him. Drawn to something more active and social, he toyed with the idea of squeezing in an economics major along with premed, but abandoned that idea when he got to college. <i class=\"calibre5\">Gotta stay on track.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ryan sailed through the premed curriculum and became a teaching assistant for undergrads while he was still an undergrad himself. When he showed up at exam review sessions and saw how stressed the students were, he refused to start covering the material until they stood up and danced. When he was accepted to an Ivy League medical school, he asked me if he should do a joint M.D.\\xe2\\x80\\x93M.B.A. program. He hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lost his interest in business, but he was afraid to divide his attention. <i class=\"calibre5\">Gotta stay on track.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In his last year of med school, Ryan dutifully applied to neurosurgery residencies. It takes a focused brain to slice into the brain of another human. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure if he was cut out for it\\xe2\\x80\\x94or if the career would leave any space for him to have a life. He wondered if he should start a health-care company instead, but when he was admitted to Yale, he opted for the residency. <i class=\"calibre5\">Gotta stay on track.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Partway through his residency, the grueling hours and the intense focus began to take their toll, and Ryan burned out. He felt that if he died that very day, no one in the system would really care or even notice. He regularly suffered from the heartache of losing patients and the headache of dealing with abusive attending surgeons, and there was no end in sight. Although it was his childhood dream and our grandparents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dream, his work left little time for anything else. The sheer exhaustion left him questioning whether he should quit.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Ryan decided that he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give up. He had gone too far to change course, so he finished the seven-year neurosurgery residency. When he submitted the paperwork for his credentials, the hospital denied him because he had placed the dates on his r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 on the right instead of the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_228\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"228\"/>left. He was so fed up with the system that, out of principle, he refused to move them. After winning that battle with bureaucracy, he added another feather to his cap, doing an eighth year of a fellowship in complex, minimally invasive spinal surgery.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Today Ryan is a neurosurgeon at a major medical center. In his midthirties, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still in debt from student loans more than a decade after graduating from med school. Even though he enjoys helping people and caring for patients, the long hours and red tape undercut his enthusiasm. He tells me that if he could do it over, he would have gone a different route. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve often wondered what it would have taken to convince him to rethink his chosen line of work\\xe2\\x80\\x94and what he truly wanted out of a career.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w100-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_228\" src=\"../images/64_WhenImSuccessfulCartoon.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We all have notions of who we want to be and how we hope to lead our lives. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not limited to careers; from an early age, we develop ideas about where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll live, which school we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll attend, what kind of person we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll marry, and how many kids we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have. These images can <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText419\"/>inspire us to set bolder goals and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText420\"/>guide us toward a path to achieve them. The danger of these plans is that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText421\"/>they can give us tunnel vision, blinding us <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_229\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"229\"/>to alternative possibilities. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how time and circumstances will change what we want and even who we want to be, and locking our life GPS onto a single target can give us the right directions to the wrong destination.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">GOING INTO FORECLOSURE</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">When we dedicate ourselves to a plan and it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going as we hoped, our first instinct isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t usually to rethink it. Instead, we tend to double down and sink more resources in the plan. This pattern is called <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText422\"/>escalation of commitment. Evidence shows that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText423\"/>entrepreneurs persist with failing strategies when they should pivot, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText424\"/>NBA general managers and coaches keep investing in new contracts and more playing time for draft busts, and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText425\"/>politicians continue sending soldiers to wars that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be fought in the first place. Sunk costs are a factor, but the most important causes appear to be psychological rather than economic. Escalation of commitment happens because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rationalizing creatures, constantly <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText426\"/>searching for self-justifications for our prior beliefs as a way to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText427\"/>soothe our egos, shield our images, and validate our past decisions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Escalation of commitment is a major factor in preventable failures. Ironically, it can be fueled by one of the most celebrated engines of success: grit. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText428\"/>Grit is the combination of passion and perseverance, and research shows that it can play an important role in motivating us to accomplish long-term goals. When it comes to rethinking, though, grit may have a dark side. Experiments show that gritty people are <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText429\"/>more likely to overplay their hands in roulette and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText430\"/>more willing to stay the course in tasks at which they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re failing and success is impossible. Researchers have even suggested that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText431\"/>gritty mountaineers are more likely to die on expeditions, because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re determined to do whatever it takes to reach the summit. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fine line between heroic persistence and foolish stubbornness. Sometimes the best kind of grit is gritting our teeth and turning around.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_230\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"230\"/>Ryan escalated his commitment to medical training for sixteen years. If he had been less tenacious, he might have changed tracks sooner. Early on, he had fallen victim to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText432\"/>what psychologists call identity foreclosure\\xe2\\x80\\x94when we <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText433\"/>settle prematurely on a sense of self without enough due diligence, and close our minds to alternative selves.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In career choices, identity foreclosure often begins when adults ask kids: what do you want to be when you grow up? Pondering that question can foster a fixed mindset about work and self. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText434\"/>one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michelle Obama writes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<i class=\"calibre5\">What do you want to be when you grow up?</i> As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"50_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_1\" id=\"footnote-032-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Some kids dream too small. They foreclose on following in family footsteps and never really consider alternatives. You probably know some people who faced the opposite problem. They dreamed too big, becoming attached to a lofty vision that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realistic. Sometimes we <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText435\"/>lack the talent to pursue our callings professionally, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText436\"/>leaving them unanswered; other times there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little hope that our passions can pay the bills. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can be anything you wanna be?!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the comedian Chris Rock quipped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText437\"/>Tell the kids the truth.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. You can be anything you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good at\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0. as long as they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hiring.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Even if kids get excited about a career path that does prove realistic, what they thought was their dream job can turn out to be a nightmare. Kids might be better off learning about careers as actions to take rather than as identities to claim. When they see work as what they do rather than who they are, they become more open to exploring different possibilities.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_231\" src=\"../images/65.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_231\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"231\"/>Although children are often fascinated by science from a young age, over the course of elementary school, they tend to lose interest and confidence in their potential to be scientists. Recent studies show that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible to maintain their enthusiasm by <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText438\"/>introducing them to science differently. When second and third graders learned about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoing <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_232\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"232\"/>science\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeing scientists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they were more excited about pursuing science. Becoming a scientist might seem out of reach, but the act of experimenting is something we can all try out. Even <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText439\"/>prekindergarten students express more interest in science when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presented as something we <i class=\"calibre5\">do</i> rather than someone we <i class=\"calibre5\">are</i>.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Recently at dinner, our kids decided to go around the table to ask what everyone wanted to be when they grew up. I told them they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to choose one career; the average person ends up <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText440\"/>holding a dozen different jobs. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be one thing; they could do many things. They started brainstorming about all the things they love to do. Their lists ended up including designing Lego sets, studying space, creative writing, architecture, interior design, teaching gymnastics, photography, coaching soccer, and being a fitness YouTuber.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Choosing a career isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like finding a soul mate. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible that your ideal job hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even been invented yet. Old industries are changing, and new industries are emerging faster than ever before: it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that long ago that Google, Uber, and Instagram didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist. Your future self doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist right now, either, and your interests might change over time.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">TIME FOR A CHECKUP</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">We foreclose on all kinds of life plans. Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve committed to one, it becomes part of your identity, making it difficult to de-escalate. Declaring an English major because you love to read, only to discover that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enjoy the process of writing. Deciding to start college during a pandemic, only to conclude later that you should have considered a gap year. <i class=\"calibre5\">Gotta stay on track.</i> Ending a romantic relationship because you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want kids, only to realize years down the road that you might after all.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Identity foreclosure can stop us from evolving. In a study of amateur musicians, those who had settled on music as a professional calling were more likely to ignore career advice from a trusted adviser over the course <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_233\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"233\"/>of the following seven years. They listened to their hearts and <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText441\"/>tuned out their mentors. In some ways, identity foreclosure is the opposite of an identity crisis: instead of accepting uncertainty about who we want to become, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText442\"/>we develop compensatory conviction and plunge head over heels into a career path. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed that the students who are the most certain about their career plans at twenty are often the ones with the deepest regrets by thirty. They haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done enough rethinking along the way.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"51_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-031-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Sometimes it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking too much like politicians, eager to earn the approval of parents and peers. They become seduced by status, failing to see that no matter how much an accomplishment or affiliation impresses someone else, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a poor choice if it depresses them. In other cases it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stuck in preacher mode, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come to see a job as a sacred cause. And occasionally they pick careers in prosecutor mode, where they charge classmates with selling their souls to capitalism and hurl themselves into nonprofits in the hopes of saving the world.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Sadly, they often know too little about the job\\xe2\\x80\\x94and too little about their evolving selves\\xe2\\x80\\x94to make a lifelong commitment. They get trapped in an overconfidence cycle, taking pride in pursuing a career identity and surrounding themselves with people who validate their conviction. By the time they discover it was the wrong fit, they feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late to think again. The stakes seem too high to walk away; the sacrifices of salary, status, skill, and time seem too great. <i class=\"calibre5\">For the record, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better to lose the past two years of progress than to waste the next twenty.</i> In hindsight, identity foreclosure is a Band-Aid: it covers up an identity crisis, but fails to cure it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My advice to students is to take a cue from health-care professions. Just as they make appointments with the doctor and the dentist even <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_234\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"234\"/>when nothing is wrong, they should schedule checkups on their careers. I encourage them to put a reminder in their calendars to ask some key questions twice a year. When did you form the aspirations you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re currently pursuing, and how have you changed since then? Have you reached a learning plateau in your role or your workplace, and is it time to consider a pivot? Answering these career checkup questions is a way to periodically activate rethinking cycles. It helps students maintain humility about their ability to predict the future, contemplate doubts about their plans, and stay curious enough to discover new possibilities or reconsider previously discarded ones.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w80c-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_234\" src=\"../images/ART_66_IdentityForeclosure.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I had one student, Marissa Shandell, who scored a coveted job at a prestigious consulting firm and planned on climbing up the ladder. She kept getting promoted early but found herself working around the clock. Instead of continuing to just grit and bear it, she and her husband had a <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_235\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"235\"/>career checkup conversation every six months, talking not just about the growth trajectory of their companies but also about the growth trajectory of their jobs. After being promoted to associate partner well ahead of schedule, Marissa realized she had reached a learning plateau (and a lifestyle plateau) and decided to pursue a doctorate in management.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"52_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_3\" id=\"footnote-030-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Deciding to leave a current career path is often easier than identifying a new one. My favorite framework for navigating that challenge comes from a management professor, Herminia Ibarra. She finds that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText444\"/>as people consider career choices and transitions, it helps to think like scientists. A first step is to <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText445\"/>entertain possible selves: identify some people you admire within or outside your field, and observe what they actually do at work day by day. A second step is to develop hypotheses about how these paths might align with your own interests, skills, and values. A third step is to test out the different identities by running experiments: do informational interviews, job shadowing, and sample projects to get a taste of the work. The goal is not to confirm a particular plan but to expand your repertoire of possible selves\\xe2\\x80\\x94which keeps you open to rethinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Checkups aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t limited to careers\\xe2\\x80\\x94they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re relevant to the plans we make in every domain of our lives. A few years ago, a former student called for romantic advice. <i class=\"calibre5\">Caveat: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not that kind of psychologist.</i> He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been dating a woman for just over a year, and although it was the most fulfilling relationship he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d ever had, he was still questioning whether it was the right match. He had always imagined himself marrying a woman who was ambitious in her career or passionate about improving the world, and his girlfriend seemed less driven and more relaxed in her approach to life.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It was an ideal time for a checkup. I asked him how old he was when he formed that vision of a partner and how much he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d changed since then. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_236\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"236\"/>He said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d held it since he was a teenager and had never paused to rethink it. As we talked, he started to realize that if he and his girlfriend were happy together, ambition and passion might not be as important to him in a partner as they had been in the past. He came to understand that he was inspired by women who were highly motivated to succeed and serve because that was who he wanted to be.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Two and a half years later, he reached out with an update. He had decided to let go of his preconceived image of who his partner should be:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-1p\">I decided to open up and talk to her about how she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different from the person I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d imagined being with. Surprisingly, she told me the same thing! I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t who she imagined she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d end up with either\\xe2\\x80\\x94she expected to end up with a guy who was more of a creative, someone who was more gregarious. We accepted it and moved on. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thrilled to have left my old ideas behind to make space for the full her and everything our relationship could bring.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Just before the pandemic, he proposed to her, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now engaged.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A successful relationship requires regular rethinking. Sometimes being considerate means reconsidering something as simple as our habits. <i class=\"calibre5\">Learning not to be fashionably late to everything. Retiring that wardrobe of ratty conference T-shirts. Rolling over to snore in the other direction.</i> At other times being supportive means opening our minds to bigger life changes\\xe2\\x80\\x94moving to a different country, a different community, or a different job to support our partner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s priorities. In my student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, it meant rethinking who his fianc\\xc3\\xa9e would be, but also staying open to who she might become. She eventually switched jobs and became passionate about both her work and a personal cause of fighting educational inequity. When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re willing to update our ideas of who our partners are, it can give them freedom to evolve and our relationships room to grow.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_237\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"237\"/>Whether we do checkups with our partners, our parents, or our mentors, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth pausing once or twice a year to reflect on how our aspirations have changed. As we identify past images of our lives that are no longer relevant to our future, we can start to rethink our plans. That can set us up for happiness\\xe2\\x80\\x94as long as we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not too fixated on finding it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w50c-1em-b\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_237\" src=\"../images/67_ExistentialTherapy_1P.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">WHEN CHASING HAPPINESS CHASES IT AWAY</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">When we think about how to plan our lives, there are few things that take priority over happiness. The kingdom of Bhutan has a Gross National Happiness index. In the United States, the pursuit of happiness is so prized that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the three unalienable rights in our Declaration of Independence. If we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not careful, though, the pursuit of happiness can become a recipe for misery.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Psychologists find that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText446\"/>the more people value happiness, the less happy they often become with their lives. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true for people who naturally care about happiness and for people who are randomly assigned to reflect on <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_238\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"238\"/>why happiness matters. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even evidence that placing a great deal of importance on happiness is <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText447\"/>a risk factor for depression. Why?</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">One possibility is that when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re searching for happiness, we get too busy evaluating life to actually experience it. Instead of savoring our moments of joy, we <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText448\"/>ruminate about why our lives aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t <i class=\"calibre5\">more</i> joyful. A second likely culprit is that we spend too much time striving for peak happiness, overlooking the fact that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText449\"/>happiness depends more on the frequency of positive emotions than their intensity. A third potential factor is that when we hunt for happiness, we overemphasize pleasure at the expense of purpose. This theory is consistent with data suggesting that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText450\"/>meaning is healthier than happiness, and that people who look for purpose in their work are more successful in pursuing their passions\\xe2\\x80\\x94and less likely to quit their jobs\\xe2\\x80\\x94than those who look for joy. While enjoyment waxes and wanes, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText451\"/>meaning tends to last. A fourth explanation is that Western conceptions of happiness as an individual state leave us feeling lonely. In more collectivistic Eastern cultures, that pattern is reversed: pursuing happiness predicts higher well-being, because <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText452\"/>people prioritize social engagement over independent activities.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Last fall a student stopped by my office hours for some advice. She explained that when she chose Wharton, she had focused too much on getting into the best school and too little on finding the best fit. She wished she had picked a college with a more carefree culture and a stronger sense of community. Now that she was clear on her values, she was considering a transfer to a school that would make her happier.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">A few weeks later she told me that a moment in class had helped her rethink her plan. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the research on happiness that we discussed, the values survey she took, or the decision-making activity we did. It was a comedy sketch I showed from <i class=\"calibre5\">Saturday Night Live.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The scene stars Adam Sandler as a tour guide. In a mock commercial advertising his company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Italian tours, he mentions that customer reviews sometimes express disappointment. He takes the opportunity to remind customers about what a vacation can and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do for them:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<blockquote class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-first\">There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot a vacation can do: help you unwind, see some different-looking squirrels, but it cannot fix deeper issues, like how you behave in group settings.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract\">We can take you on a hike. We cannot turn you into someone who likes hiking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x06-extract-last\">Remember, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText453\"/>you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still gonna be <i class=\"calibre5\">you</i> on vacation. If you are sad where you are, and then you get on a plane to Italy, the you in Italy will be the same sad you from before, just in a new place.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</blockquote>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"margin-1em\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"w1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"w\" id=\"image_page_239\" src=\"../images/69_SameSad.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<figcaption class=\"calibre6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x12-caption-credit\" role=\"doc-credit\">\\xc2\\xa9 <i class=\"calibre5\">Saturday Night Live</i>/NBC</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</figcaption>\\n\\t\\t\\t</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_239\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"239\"/>When we pursue happiness, we often start by changing our surroundings. We expect to find bliss in a warmer climate or a friendlier dorm, but any <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText454\"/>joy that those choices bring about is typically temporary. In a series of studies, students who changed their environments by adjusting their living arrangements or course schedules quickly returned to their baseline levels of happiness. As Ernest Hemingway wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText455\"/>You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Meanwhile, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText456\"/>students who changed their actions by joining a new club, adjusting their study habits, or starting a new project experienced lasting gains <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_240\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"240\"/>in happiness. Our happiness often depends more on what we do than where we are. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our actions\\xe2\\x80\\x94not our surroundings\\xe2\\x80\\x94that bring us meaning and belonging.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My student decided not to transfer. Instead of rethinking where she went to school, she would rethink how she spent her time. She might not be able to change the culture of an entire institution, but she could create a new subculture. She started doing weekly coffee chats with classmates and invited the ones who shared her interests and values over for weekly tea. A few months later, she reported that she had formed several close friendships and was thrilled with her decision to stay. The impact didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop there: her tea gatherings became a tradition for welcoming students who felt out of place. Instead of transferring to a new community, they <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText457\"/>built their own microcommunity. They weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t focusing on happiness\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were looking for contribution and connection.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3 class=\"x05-head-a\">LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF MEANING</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\">To be clear, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t encourage anyone to stay in a role, relationship, or place they hated unless they had no other alternatives. Still, when it comes to careers, instead of searching for the job where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be happiest, we might be better off pursuing the job where we expect to learn and contribute the most.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Psychologists find that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText458\"/>passions are often developed, not discovered. In a study of entrepreneurs, the more effort they put into their startups, the more their enthusiasm about their businesses climbed each week. <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText459\"/>Their passion grew as they gained momentum and mastery. Interest doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always lead to effort and skill; sometimes it follows them. By investing in learning and problem solving, we can develop our passions\\xe2\\x80\\x94and build the skills necessary to do the work and lead the lives we find worthwhile.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">As we get older, we become more focused on searching for meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x94and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re most likely to find it in <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText460\"/>actions that benefit others. My favorite <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_241\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"241\"/>test of meaningful work is to ask: if this job didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist, how much worse off would people be? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s near midlife that this question often begins to loom large. At around this time, in both work and life, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText461\"/>we feel we have more to give (and less to lose), and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re especially keen to share our knowledge and skills with the next generation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">When my students talk about the evolution of self-esteem in their careers, the progression often goes something like this:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-first\" role=\"listitem\">Phase 1: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not important</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered\" role=\"listitem\">Phase 2: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m important</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-last\" role=\"listitem\">Phase 3: I want to contribute to something important</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed that the sooner they get to phase 3, the more impact they have and the more happiness they experience. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left me thinking about happiness less as a goal and more as a by-product of mastery and meaning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose only are happy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText462\"/>they find happiness by the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Careers, relationships, and communities are examples of <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText463\"/>what scientists call open systems\\xe2\\x80\\x94they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re constantly in flux because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not closed off from the environments around them. We know that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText464\"/>open systems are governed by at least two key principles: there are always multiple paths to the same end (equifinality), and the same starting point can be a path to many different ends (multifinality). We should be careful to avoid getting too attached to a particular route or even a particular destination. There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one definition of success or one track to happiness.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My cousin Ryan finally wound up rethinking his career arc. Five years into his neurosurgery residency, he did his own version of a career checkup and decided to scratch his entrepreneurial itch. He cofounded a fast-growing, venture-backed startup called Nomad Health, which <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_242\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"242\"/>creates a marketplace to match clinicians with medical facilities. He also advised several medical device startups, filed medical device patents, and is now working on multiple startups to improve health care. Looking back, he still regrets that he foreclosed so early on an identity as a neurosurgeon and escalated his commitment to that career.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">At work and in life, the best we can do is plan for what we want to learn and contribute over the next year or two, and stay open to what might come next. To adapt an analogy from E. L. Doctorow, writing out a plan for your life \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText465\"/>you can make the whole trip that way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<hr class=\"transition\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"x04-space-break-orn\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"h1em-orn\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"../images/1.jpg\"/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x03-co-body-text\"><span class=\"scap\">We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have</span> <span class=\"scap\">to upend</span> our entire paths to rethink some of our plans. Some people are perfectly content with their fields of work but dissatisfied with their current roles. Others may be too risk averse to make a geographic move for a job or a partner. And many don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the luxury of making a pivot: being economically dependent on a job or emotionally attached to an extended family can limit the options available. Whether or not we have the opportunity or appetite for major changes in our lives, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still possible to make smaller adjustments that breathe new meaning into our days.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My colleagues Amy Wrzesniewski and Jane Dutton find that in every line of work, there are people who become active architects of their own jobs. They <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText466\"/>rethink their roles through job crafting\\xe2\\x80\\x94changing their daily actions to better fit their values, interests, and skills. One of the places Amy and Jane studied job crafting was in the University of Michigan health-care system.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">If you visited a certain floor of the hospital, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be long before cancer patients told you <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText467\"/>how grateful they were for Candice Walker. Her mission was not only to protect their fragile immune systems\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was also to care for their fragile emotions. She called the chemotherapy center the House of Hope.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_243\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"243\"/>Candice was often the first one to console families when their loved ones went through treatment; she showed up with bagels and coffee. She would make patients laugh by telling stories about her cats drinking her milk or showing them that she had accidentally put on one brown sock and one blue sock. One day she saw a patient on the floor of an elevator writhing in pain, and the staff members nearby weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure what to do. Candice immediately took charge, rushed the woman into a wheelchair, and took her up in the elevator for urgent treatment. The patient later called her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy savior.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Candice Walker wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a doctor or a nurse. She wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a social worker, either. She was a custodian. Her official job was to keep the cancer center clean.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Candice and her fellow custodians were all hired to do the same job, but some of them <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText468\"/>ended up rethinking their roles. One cleaner on a long-term intensive care unit took it upon herself to regularly rearrange the paintings on the walls, hoping that a change of scenery might spark some awareness among patients in comas. When asked about it, she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText469\"/>No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not part of my job, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Our identities are open systems, and so are our lives. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to stay tethered to old images of where we want to go or who we want to be. The simplest way to start rethinking our options is to question what we do daily.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It takes humility to reconsider our past commitments, doubt to question our present decisions, and curiosity to reimagine our future plans. What we discover along the way can free us from the shackles of our familiar surroundings and our former selves. Rethinking liberates us to do more than update our knowledge and opinions\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tool for leading a more fulfilling <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_244\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"244\"/>life.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

As long as I can remember, whether I was devouring sci-fi like <i class=\"calibre5\">Ender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Game</i> or mystery like <i class=\"calibre5\">The Westing Game</i>, the twist at the end wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just the highlight of the story. It transformed the story, making me rethink everything I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d read before.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In writing about ideas, though, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never liked conclusions. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the final chapter just serve as the end? <i class=\"calibre5\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a book, not a book report.

If a topic is important enough to deserve an entire book, it shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t end. It should be open-ended.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an inherent challenge for <i class=\"calibre5\">Think Again</i>. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the conclusion to bring closure. I want my thinking to keep evolving. To symbolize that openness, I decided to make the epilogue a blank page. Literally.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_246\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"246\"/>My challenge network unanimously rejected that concept. Two of my most insightful students convinced me that although it might represent an endpoint for me as a writer, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a starting point for you as a reader\\xe2\\x80\\x94a springboard to new thoughts and a bridge to new conversations. Then they proposed a way to honor the spirit of the book: I could take a cue from Ron Berger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s classroom and show some of my rethinking of the conclusion from one draft to the next.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I loved the idea.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"54_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_2\" id=\"footnote-036-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> <span class=\"strike\">For a book about rethinking, it seemed delightfully meta.

For thousands of years, much of the rethinking that people did unfolded invisibly in groups over time. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_247\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"247\"/>Before the printing press, a great deal of knowledge was transmitted orally. Human history was one long game of telephone, where each sender would remember and convey information differently, and each receiver would have no way of knowing how the story had changed. By the time an idea traveled across a land, it could be completely reimagined without anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being aware of it. As more information began to be recorded in books and then newspapers, we could begin to track the different ways in which knowledge and beliefs evolved. Today, although we can see every revision made in Wikipedia, the individuals making the changes often wind up in edit wars, refusing to concede that others were right or that they were wrong. Codifying knowledge might help us track it, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily lead us to open our minds.</span></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span class=\"underline\">Many great thinkers have argued that rethinking is a task for each generation, not each person\\xe2\\x80\\x94even in science. As the eminent physicist Max Planck put it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText472\"/>A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</span> <span class=\"underline\">From this perspective, <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText473\"/>generations are replaced faster than people change their views.</span></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span class=\"underline\">I no longer believe that has to be the case. We all have the capacity to think again\\xe2\\x80\\x94we just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it often enough, because we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think like scientists often enough.</span></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span class=\"underline\">The scientific method can be traced back several millennia, at least as far back as Aristotle and the ancient Greeks. I was surprised to learn, then, that <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText474\"/>the word</span> <i class=\"underline_ital\">scientist</i> <span class=\"underline\">is relatively new: it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t coined until 1833.</span> <span class=\"underline\">For centuries, there was no general term for people whose profession was to discover knowledge through developing hypotheses, designing experiments, and collecting data. I hope we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_248\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"248\"/>wait that long to recognize that this way of thinking applies to every line of work\\xe2\\x80\\x94and any walk of life.</span></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span class=\"underline\">Even as this book goes to press, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still rethinking.</span> In making the case for thinking like a scientist, something has been nagging at me. I wonder if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve devoted too little attention to the situations in which it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s productive to preach, prosecute, and politick. When it comes to rethinking our own views, the weight of the evidence favors the scientist mode as giving us the best odds.<a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"57_Footnote.xhtml#footnote_5\" id=\"footnote-033-backlink\" role=\"doc-noteref\" title=\"footnote\" class=\"calibre2\">*</a> But the ideal mode is less clear cut when it comes to opening other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds. I tried to capture the nuances in the value of each approach, exploring how preaching can be effective in debates with people who are receptive to our viewpoint or aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t invested in the issue; prosecuting can get through to audiences who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t determined to be in control; and simplicity can persuade our own political tribe. But even after reviewing these data points, I still wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure whether I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d done enough to qualify my argument.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Then the coronavirus pandemic happened, and I became curious about how leaders communicate during crisis. <span class=\"underline\">How do they give people a sense of security in the present and hope for the future? Preaching the virtues of their plans and prosecuting alternative proposals could reduce uncertainty. Making a political case might rally the base around shared goals.</span></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">For me, the most instructive example came from the governor of New York. In an early speech in the spring, as his state and the nation faced an unprecedented crisis, he announced, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText475\"/>above all, try something.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><i class=\"calibre5\">The</i> <i class=\"calibre5\">New York Times</i> quickly eviscerated the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_249\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"249\"/>speech, noting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText476\"/>something unspecified is no better than nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Whereas other leaders were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprecise, concrete, positive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the governor was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindefinite, abstract, irresolute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just the media that trashed the speech\\xe2\\x80\\x94one of the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own advisers apparently described it as an <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText477\"/>act of political stupidity.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to see the appeal of a confident leader who offers a clear vision, a strong plan, and a definitive forecast for the future. But in times of crisis as well as times of prosperity, what we need more is a leader who accepts uncertainty, acknowledges mistakes, learns from others, and rethinks plans. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what this particular governor was offering, and the early critics were wrong about how his proposed approach would unfold.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">This didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen during the coronavirus pandemic, and the governor wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Andrew Cuomo. It occurred the last time unemployment in America was so high: during the Great Depression. It was 1932, and the governor of New York was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He delivered his \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctry something\\xe2\\x80\\x9d message as the country was reeling from the Great Depression, in a commencement speech at a small university in Georgia. In the most memorable line from the speech, FDR argued that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe country demands bold, persistent experimentation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That principle became a touchstone of his leadership. Although economists are still debating which of the resulting reforms lifted the country out of a historic depression, FDR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial-and-error method of formulating policy was popular enough that Americans elected him president four times.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">In his commencement speech, FDR wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t preaching, prosecuting, or appealing to politics. He spoke with the same kind of confident humility that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d expect from a <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_250\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"250\"/>scientist. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about how to communicate confident humility. When people lack knowledge about a complex topic\\xe2\\x80\\x94like stopping a pandemic or reinvigorating an economy\\xe2\\x80\\x94they might be comfortable with leaders admitting what they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know today and doubting the statements they made yesterday. When people feel more informed and the problem is simpler, they might dismiss leaders who acknowledge uncertainty and change their minds as flip-floppers.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still curious about when each mode is most effective for persuasion, but on balance, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to see more people do their rethinking out loud, as FDR did. As valuable as rethinking is, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it enough\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re grappling with the pivotal decisions of our lives or the great quandaries of our time. Complex problems like pandemics, climate change, and political polarization call on us to stay mentally flexible. In the face of any number of unknown and evolving threats, humility, doubt, and curiosity are vital to discovery. <span class=\"underline\">Bold, persistent experimentation might be our best tool for rethinking.</span></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">We can all improve at thinking again. Whatever conclusion we reach, I think the world would be a better place if everyone put on scientist goggles a little more often. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m curious: do you agree? If not, what evidence would change your mind?</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

INDIVIDUAL RETHINKING</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\">A. Develop the Habit of Thinking Again</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">1. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Think like a scientist.</i> When you start forming an opinion, resist the temptation to preach, prosecute, or politick. Treat your emerging view as a hunch or a hypothesis and test it with data. Like the entrepreneurs who learned to approach their business strategies as experiments, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll maintain the agility to pivot.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">2. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Define your identity in terms of values, not opinions.</i> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easier to avoid getting stuck to your past beliefs if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t become attached to them as part of your present self-concept. See yourself as someone who values curiosity, learning, mental flexibility, and searching for knowledge. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_252\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"252\"/>As you form opinions, keep a list of factors that would change your mind.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">3. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Seek out information that goes against your views.</i> You can fight confirmation bias, burst filter bubbles, and escape echo chambers by actively engaging with ideas that challenge your assumptions. An easy place to start is to follow people who make you think\\xe2\\x80\\x94even if you usually disagree with what they think.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\">B. Calibrate Your Confidence</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">4. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Beware of getting stranded at the summit of Mount Stupid.</i> Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t confuse confidence with competence. The Dunning-Kruger effect is a good reminder that the better you think you are, the greater the risk that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re overestimating yourself\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the greater the odds that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stop improving. To prevent overconfidence in your knowledge, reflect on how well you can explain a given subject.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">5. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Harness the benefits of doubt.</i> When you find yourself doubting your ability, reframe the situation as an opportunity for growth. You can have confidence in your capacity to learn while questioning your current solution to a problem. Knowing what you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know is often the first step toward developing expertise.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">6. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Embrace the joy of being wrong.</i> When you find out you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made a mistake, take it as a sign that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just discovered something new. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be afraid to laugh at yourself. It helps you focus less on proving yourself\\xe2\\x80\\x94and more on improving yourself.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_253\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"253\"/>C. Invite Others to Question Your Thinking</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">7. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Learn something new from each person you meet.</i> Everyone knows more than you about something. Ask people what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been rethinking lately, or start a conversation about times you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve changed your mind in the past year.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">8. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Build a challenge network, not just a support network.</i> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helpful to have cheerleaders encouraging you, but you also need critics to challenge you. Who are your most thoughtful critics? Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve identified them, invite them to question your thinking. To make sure they know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re open to dissenting views, tell them why you respect their pushback\\xe2\\x80\\x94and where they usually add the most value.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">9. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shy away from constructive conflict.</i> Disagreements don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be disagreeable. Although relationship conflict is usually counterproductive, task conflict can help you think again. Try framing disagreement as a debate: people are more likely to approach it intellectually and less likely to take it personally.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"x07-list-unumbered-head\">II. INTERPERSONAL RETHINKING</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\">A. Ask Better Questions</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">10. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Practice the art of persuasive listening.</i> When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to open other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds, we can frequently accomplish more by listening than by talking. How can you show an interest in helping people crystallize their own views and uncover their own reasons for change? A good way to start is to increase your question-to-statement ratio.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_254\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"254\"/>11. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Question how rather than why.</i> When people describe <i class=\"calibre5\">why</i> they hold extreme views, they often intensify their commitment and double down. When they try to explain <i class=\"calibre5\">how</i> they would make their views a reality, they often realize the limits of their understanding and start to temper some of their opinions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">12. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Ask \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat evidence would change your mind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</i> You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bully someone into agreeing with you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often more effective to inquire about what would open their minds, and then see if you can convince them on their own terms.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">13. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Ask how people originally formed an opinion.</i> Many of our opinions, like our stereotypes, are arbitrary; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve developed them without rigorous data or deep reflection. To help people reevaluate, prompt them to consider how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d believe different things if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been born at a different time or in a different place.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\">B. Approach Disagreements as Dances, Not Battles</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">14. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Acknowledge common ground.</i> A debate is like a dance, not a war. Admitting points of convergence doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make you weaker\\xe2\\x80\\x94it shows that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re willing to negotiate about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, and it motivates the other side to consider your point of view.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">15. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Remember that less is often more.</i> If you pile on too many different reasons to support your case, it can make your audiences defensive\\xe2\\x80\\x94and cause them to reject your entire argument based on its least compelling points. Instead of diluting your argument, lead with a few of your strongest points.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_255\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"255\"/>16. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Reinforce freedom of choice.</i> Sometimes people resist not because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dismissing the argument but because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rejecting the feeling of their behavior being controlled. It helps to respect their autonomy by reminding them that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to them to choose what they believe.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">17. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Have a conversation about the conversation.</i> If emotions are running hot, try redirecting the discussion to the process. Like the expert negotiators who comment on their feelings and test their understanding of the other side\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings, you can sometimes make progress by expressing your disappointment or frustration and asking people if they share it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"x07-list-unumbered-head\">III. COLLECTIVE RETHINKING</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\">A. Have More Nuanced Conversations</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">18. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Complexify contentious topics.</i> There are more than two sides to every story. Instead of treating polarizing issues like two sides of a coin, look at them through the many lenses of a prism. Seeing the shades of gray can make us more open.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">19. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shy away from caveats and contingencies.</i> Acknowledging competing claims and conflicting results doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sacrifice interest or credibility. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an effective way to engage audiences while encouraging them to stay curious.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">20. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Expand your emotional range.</i> You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to eliminate frustration or even indignation to have a productive conversation. You just need to mix in a broader set of emotions along with them\\xe2\\x80\\x94you might try showing some curiosity or even admitting confusion or ambivalence.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_256\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"256\"/>B. Teach Kids to Think Again</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">21. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Have a weekly myth-busting discussion at dinner.</i> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easier to debunk false beliefs at an early age, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great way to teach kids to become comfortable with rethinking. Pick a different topic each week\\xe2\\x80\\x94one day it might be dinosaurs, the next it could be outer space\\xe2\\x80\\x94and rotate responsibility around the family for bringing a myth for discussion.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">22. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Invite kids to do multiple drafts and seek feedback from others.</i> Creating different versions of a drawing or a story can encourage kids to learn the value of revising their ideas. Getting input from others can also help them to continue evolving their standards. They might learn to embrace confusion\\xe2\\x80\\x94and to stop expecting perfection on the first try.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">23. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Stop asking kids what they want to be when they grow up.</i> They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to define themselves in terms of a career. A single identity can close the door to alternatives. Instead of trying to narrow their options, help them broaden their possibilities. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be one thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94they can do many things.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\">C. Create Learning Organizations</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">24. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Abandon best practices.</i> Best practices suggest that the ideal routines are already in place. If we want people to keep rethinking the way they work, we might be better off adopting process accountability and continually striving for better practices.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">25. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Establish psychological safety.</i> In learning cultures, people feel confident that they can question and challenge the status quo without being punished. Psychological safety often starts with leaders role-modeling humility.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_257\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"257\"/>26. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Keep a rethinking scorecard.</i> Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t evaluate decisions based only on the results; track how thoroughly different options are considered in the process. A bad process with a good outcome is luck. A good process with a bad outcome might be a smart experiment.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-head\">D. Stay Open to Rethinking Your Future</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div role=\"list\" class=\"calibre1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">27. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Throw out the ten-year plan.</i> What interested you last year might bore you this year\\xe2\\x80\\x94and what confused you yesterday might become exciting tomorrow. Passions are developed, not just discovered. Planning just one step ahead can keep you open to rethinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">28. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Rethink your actions, not just your surroundings.</i> Chasing happiness can chase it away. Trading one set of circumstances for another isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always enough. Joy can wax and wane, but meaning is more likely to last. Building a sense of purpose often starts with taking actions to enhance your learning or your contribution to others.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">29. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Schedule a life checkup.</i> It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to get caught in escalation of commitment to an unfulfilling path. Just as you schedule health checkups with your doctor, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth having a life checkup on your calendar once or twice a year. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a way to assess how much you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re learning, how your beliefs and goals are evolving, and whether your next steps warrant some rethinking.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x07-list-unnumbered-para-first\" role=\"listitem\">30. <i class=\"bold_ital\">Make time to think again.</i> When I looked at my calendar, I noticed that it was mostly full of doing. I set a goal of spending an hour a day thinking and learning. Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve decided to go further: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m scheduling a weekly time for rethinking and unlearning. I reach out to my challenge network and ask what ideas and opinions they think I should be reconsidering. Recently, my wife, Allison, told me that I need to rethink the way I pronounce the word <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_258\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"258\"/><i class=\"calibre5\">mayonnaise</i>.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

I want to start by commending literary agent extraordinaire Richard Pine for inspiring me to rethink my audience and continue broadening my lens beyond work, and editor par excellence Rick Kot for believing in and developing the potential of these ideas. As always, it was a dream to work with the two of them, and they offered the ideal blend of challenge and support.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The accuracy of this book was enhanced by the meticulous work of two professional fact-checkers. Paul Durbin applied his eagle eye to every sentence, working with remarkable thoroughness and alacrity. Andy Young carefully reviewed every page and followed up with a number of key sources.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">The content and tone of the book benefited immeasurably from the early readers in my challenge network. Marissa Shandell and Karren Knowlton were exceedingly generous in reading more chapter drafts than any human should endure and unfailingly brilliant in improving them. I cannot thank them enough for enriching every section of the book with leads on characters, suggestions on flow, and refinements on language. <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_260\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"260\"/>Marissa went the extra mile to enliven concepts and synthesize practical takeaways. Karren went above and beyond to amplify complexity and diversify thought.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Reb Rebele, whose taste in ideas and prose is second to none, dished out the tough love that the early chapters needed and brought the seasoning that was missing from the denouements. Queen of signposting Grace Rubenstein offered sage guidance for helping readers see the forest in the trees and recognize thinking again as a habit that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s both timely and timeless. Dan O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Donnell helped me de-escalate my commitment to a series of dead ends and composed the written version of jaunty music to animate several key studies and stories.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Lindsay Miller\\xe2\\x80\\x94the human equivalent of the corpus callosum\\xe2\\x80\\x94led the cheer for more conversational snippets and richer illustrations of how the preacher, prosecutor, politician, and scientist waltz into our psyches. Nicole Granet expanded my thinking around how rethinking is relevant to every domain of life. Sheryl Sandberg sharpened the structure by convincing me to introduce the core idea before the organizing framework, and underscoring the value of well-placed bookends. Constantinos Coutifaris made the vital point that I needed to explore when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persuasive to preach, prosecute, and politick. Natalia Villarman, Neal Stewart, and Will Fields shared their expertise on antiracism. Michael Choo motivated me to go back to the drawing board on a chapter that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working. Justin Berg lent his creative forecasting skills to select and develop my most novel and useful insights, and also introduced me to the satisfaction of reverse alliteration (where sequential words share a last letter or syllable). Susan Grant, ever the English teacher, corrected grammar, caught typos, and fought with me about the Oxford comma. <i class=\"calibre5\">Sorry, Mom, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one thing I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t plan to rethink.</i></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Impact Lab reminded me once again how much teachers can learn from students. Vanessa Wanyandeh challenged me to consider how power imbalances affect which groups should be doing the majority of the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_261\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"261\"/>rethinking and highlight whose responsibility it is to fight prejudice. Akash Pulluru fearlessly obliterated weak arguments and debated the principles of good debate. Graelin Mandel called for more information about when and why task conflict causes relationship conflict, and Zach Sweeney made a passionate case for expanding the role of the rethinking cycle. Jordan Lei pushed me to delve more deeply into the first-instinct fallacy, and Shane Goldstein took the lead in talking me out of the blank-page epilogue and into showing some edits and margin notes. Nicholas Strauch requested more context on how to ask good questions and defended the frog, and Madeline Fagen suggested more clarity on the distinction between beliefs and values. Wendy Lee advised me to go into more detail on expressing confident humility, Kenny Hoang suggested I demonstrate some of the interpersonal rethinking principles in my writing, and Lizzie Youshaei called for more analysis of when and why people are open to being wrong. Meg Sreenivas pointed out extraneous details, Aaron Kahane clarified confusing arguments, and Shaheel Mitra suggested the Edgar Mitchell quote.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">I was lucky to have the support of top-notch teams at InkWell (shout-out to Alexis Hurley, Nathaniel Jacks, and Eliza Rothstein) and Viking (a group of people whose curiosity I miss every week I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not writing or launching a book). Special thanks to Carolyn Coleburn, Whitney Peeling, Lindsay Prevette, and Bel Banta for their publicity prowess; Kate Stark, Lydia Hirt, and Mary Stone for their creative marketing; Tricia Conley, Tess Espinoza, Bruce Giffords, and Fabiana Van Arsdell for their editorial and production expertise; Jason Ramirez for art direction; Camille LeBlanc for wrangling; and Brian Tart, Andrea Schulz, Madeline McIntosh, Allison Dobson, and speed demon Markus Dohle for their ongoing support. Also, it was a delight to collaborate with Matt Shirley on the charts. Along with lending his characteristic cleverness and humor, he showed impressive patience in working to make sure they fit the content and tone of the book.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_262\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"262\"/>A number of colleagues contributed to this book through conversations. As always, Dan Pink gave excellent input on framing the idea and tips on relevant research. My colleagues at Wharton\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially Rachel Arnett, Sigal Barsade, Drew Carton, Stephanie Creary, Angela Duckworth, Cade Massey, Samir Nurmohamed, and Nancy Rothbard\\xe2\\x80\\x94modeled many of the principles in the book and led me to think again about many of the points I was making. I am also grateful to Phil Tetlock for the preacher-prosecutor-politician framework and referrals to Kjirste Morrell and Jean-Pierre Beugoms; Eva Chen, Terry Murray, and Phil Rescober for the analysis of Jean-Pierre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forecasts; Bob Sutton for putting Brad Bird on my radar and analyzing his <i class=\"calibre5\">Incredibles</i> leadership so perceptively, as well as Jamie Woolf and Chris Wiggum for opening the Pixar door; Karl Weick for introducing me to Mann Gulch; Shannon Sedgwick Davis and Laren Poole for putting me in touch with Betty Bigombe and sharing background on her story; Jeff Ashby and Mike Bloomfield for the referrals to Chris Hansen and Ellen Ochoa; Eoghan Sheehy for the connection to Harish Natarajan; and Douglas Archibald for recommending Ron Berger (props to Noah Devereaux and the Strive Challenge for that serendipitous conversation). Early on, Eric Best showed me how rethinking could help people raise the bar, and Brian Little, Jane Dutton, Richard Hackman, and Sue Ashford taught me to see rethinking as one of the great joys of being an organizational psychologist.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">Every day, being a parent shows me that we all have the innate capacity to change our minds. As I finished writing this book during the pandemic, Henry wondered if the water supply might be affected and was eager to rethink where we get running water (<i class=\"calibre5\">Is there a tube that connects the ocean to our house? We might get an octopus!</i>). When I asked how she convinces me to rethink things, Elena opened my eyes to a persuasion technique I had completely overlooked (<i class=\"calibre5\">Puppy dog eyes! Works every time!</i>). When we were considering various optical illusions for the jacket of this book, Joanna came up with a better idea (<i class=\"calibre5\">What about a candle with a flame that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water instead of fire?</i>). I came away rethinking where creative <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_263\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"263\"/>ideas come from: if our twelve-year-old can come up with the perfect image for my book jacket, what else can kids do? I love how happily and effortlessly our children think again\\xe2\\x80\\x94and how they coax me to do it more often, too.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"x04-body-text\">My deep gratitude goes to Allison Sweet Grant for her love, advice, and humor every step of the way. As always, she helped me rethink many of my assumptions and put up with countless trivial questions, random requests, and unnecessary debates. I still pronounce it <i class=\"calibre5\">man-aze,</i> not <i class=\"calibre5\">may-o-naze</i>, but she makes a compelling point that no one says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease pass the man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease pass the mayo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For the record, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even like <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page_264\" role=\"doc-pagebreak\" title=\"264\"/>mayonnaise.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

The gloom-and-doom message can create a burning platform for those who fear a burning planet.

People across the spectrum of climate skepticism, from alarmed to doubtful, are more determined to take initiative when they believe it would produce identifiable benefits. And instead of just appealing to stereotypical liberal values like compassion and justice, research suggests that journalists can spur more action by emphasizing crosscutting values like defending freedom as well as more conservative values like <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText331\"/>preserving the purity of nature or <span id=\"EndnotePhraseInText332\"/>protecting the planet as an act of patriotism.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

To investigate that possibility, they changed the premise and ran an experiment. Imagine that you wake up one day to learn that your whole life has been an experience machine that you chose years earlier, and you now get to choose whether to unplug or plug back in. In that scenario, 46 percent of people said they wanted to plug back in. If they were told that unplugging would take them back to \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a multimillionaire artist based in Monaco, 50 percent of people still wanted to plug back in.

Then I went looking for the best evidence available from randomized, controlled experiments and systematic field studies. Where the evidence didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist, I launched my own research projects. Only when I had reached a data-driven insight did I search for stories to illustrate and illuminate the studies. In an ideal world, every insight would come from a meta-analysis\\xe2\\x80\\x94a study of studies, where researchers cumulate the patterns across a whole body of evidence, adjusting for the quality of each data point. Where those aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t available, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve highlighted studies that I find rigorous, representative, or thought provoking. Sometimes I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll include details on the methods\\xe2\\x80\\x94not only so you can understand how the researchers formed their conclusions, but to offer a window into how scientists think. In many places, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll summarize the results without going into depth on the studies themselves, under the assumption that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reading to rethink like a scientist\\xe2\\x80\\x94not to become one. That said, if you felt a jolt of excitement at the mention of a meta-analysis, it might be time to (re)consider a career in social science.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",
