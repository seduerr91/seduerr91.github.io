| [How Exa built a Web Research Multi-Agent System with LangGraph and LangSmith](https://blog.langchain.com/exa/) | LangChain | Exa, a prominent search API provider, has launched a cutting-edge deep research agent. The agent, powered by LangGraph, processes research queries quickly, delivering structured results in 15 seconds to 3 minutes. Exa's evolution into agentic search reflects industry trends towards more sophisticated LLM applications. The system's multi-agent architecture, including Planner, Tasks, and Observer components, demonstrates intentional context engineering and dynamic task generation. Exa's focus on structured output, observability with LangSmith, and key design insights from other systems ensure efficient performance. Their system highlights the importance of observability, reusability, structured output, and dynamic task creation for teams developing similar systems. This successful implementation showcases the capabilities of LangGraph for building advanced multi-agent systems. |
