A new research framework, MindJourney, enables AI agents to explore and improve their spatial interpretation of 3D spaces beyond 2D images. MindJourney utilizes a world model to navigate 3D space by generating various perspectives, enhancing the agents' spatial reasoning performance. By combining world models with vision-language models (VLMs), agents can interpret complex spatial relationships, potentially benefiting fields like robotics and accessibility tools. The framework's approach of allowing agents to explore and interpret spaces within a simulated environment enhances their ability to plan actions effectively. Future enhancements may include predicting how scenes evolve over time, further enhancing agents' spatial understanding in dynamic environments.
