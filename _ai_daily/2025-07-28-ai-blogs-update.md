The emergence of advanced agentic applications, which perform complex and multi-step tasks, is driving the need for specialized "agent infrastructure." Key infrastructure features include durable execution, state management, human-in-the-loop coordination, and support for bursty, concurrent workloads. Solutions like LangGraph Platform exemplify this trend, providing scalable, reliable tools that simplify the deployment and management of these sophisticated agents. The overarching trend is an industry-wide shift toward more robust infrastructure to support the growing demands and complexity of modern agentic applications.

| [Why agent infrastructure matters](https://blog.langchain.com/why-agent-infrastructure/) | LangChain | The blog post discusses how the rise of agentic applications, which involve complex, multi-step tasks beyond basic chat interfaces, necessitates a new type of infrastructure called agent infrastructure. This infrastructure supports long-running, stateful, and bursty agentic workloads, providing features like durable execution, state management, human-in-the-loop coordination, handling bursty concurrency, and enabling streaming of intermediate output. LangGraph Platform is introduced as an example of a solution offering scalable, reliable agent infrastructure for deploying and running agentic applications. It simplifies the complexities of running stateful agents, allowing developers to focus on logic and behavior. Overall, the post emphasizes the importance of adopting agent infrastructure to support the future of agentic applications effectively. |
