| [Policy Zones: How Meta enforces purpose limitation at scale in batch processing systems](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/07/23/security/policy-zones-meta-purpose-limitation-batch-processing-systems/) | Meta AI | Meta has developed Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) and Policy Zones to enforce purpose limitations on data in large-scale batch processing systems. Policy Zones integrates with Meta's exabyte-scale data warehouse and processing systems to perform trillions of consent checks and petabytes of data transport per hour. Engineers can use tools to quickly respond to privacy requirements and deploy Policy Zones across data assets and processors. This technology is used at scale in batch processing systems to meet privacy commitments, with ongoing investment to enhance usability. Policy Zones leverages Information Flow Control principles to track and protect data flows by enforcing flow restrictions at runtime. The system operates at massive scale, controlling access for millions of datasets and analyzing tens of millions of data flows daily. |
