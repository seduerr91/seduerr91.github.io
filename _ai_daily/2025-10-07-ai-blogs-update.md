Recent blog posts highlight two major trends in AI prompt engineering: a strong focus on enhancing prompt effectiveness through structured guidance, and a robust emphasis on achieving resilience and consistency in outputs. Practical frameworks and detailed guides are offered for both video (Sora 2) and text-based AI systems, advocating for a blend of precise specifications and creative flexibility. Key recommendations include explicit parameter configuration, thoughtful prompt iteration, and the use of visual or structured references. Additionally, systematic evaluation methodologies—such as the "evaluation flywheel" and automated grading—are promoted to diagnose and improve model performance. Collectively, these posts underscore the importance of continuous experimentation, rigorous analysis, and workflow integration to produce high-quality, reliable AI-generated content.

## New Cookbook Recipes

The blog post provides a comprehensive guide on crafting effective video prompts for Sora 2, emphasizing the balance between specificity and creative freedom. Key strategies include treating prompts as "creative wish lists" to maximize iterative output while permitting variations. It outlines essential API parameters such as model type, video resolution, and length, which must be set explicitly in API calls. For optimal results, detailed descriptions of camera setup, lighting, and action timing are critical. The post also highlights the importance of maintaining consistency in lighting and dialogue structure for seamless edits. Visual references can be incorporated to enhance the prompt, allowing for precise creative direction. Overall, the guide encourages users to experiment and refine their approach to achieve desired video outcomes.

The blog post introduces a practical cookbook designed to help AI practitioners enhance the resilience of their prompts using the OpenAI Platform. A resilient prompt provides consistent, high-quality responses regardless of varying inputs, addressing the brittleness often seen in AI applications. The core methodology proposed is the "evaluation flywheel," a continuous, three-phase process—Analyze, Measure, and Improve—aimed at systematically diagnosing and refining models.

Key features include manual and automated evaluation techniques, such as open and axial coding for error classification, and the implementation of automated graders for performance assessment. Additionally, the blog emphasizes the importance of using synthetic data to bolster testing and aligning automated judges with expert evaluations for improved reliability. Ultimately, it encourages integrating these practices into regular engineering workflows to sustain prompt resilience in production settings.
