## Investing for Young People in 2024

Aspiring investors and newcomers to the world of saving have an array of important principles to master. Among the most vital are these proven methods: start investing soon to allow compound interest to do its wondrous work. Trim any extraneous costs to prevent eroding the gains made from compounding. Spread your investments across various sectors. Don't attempt to outguess the market's moves—leave that to the professionals. Hold fast to your chosen investment approach, especially during tumultuous times. And resist the temptation to follow the crowd into the latest investment craze just because it seems everyone else is profiting.

Alongside these established rules, today's youth must come to terms with a markedly less rosy prospect: the future may not hold the same level of returns as previous generations experienced. Despite financial downturns in history, the years leading up to recent times have been remarkably lucrative for investors, with significant returns on both stocks and bonds.

The era characterized by these high returns is likely coming to an end, marked by shifts in global economic patterns and the end of a prolonged period of falling interest rates. As a result, younger investors now find themselves navigating a more challenging terrain, with critical decisions to make about their savings and how to maximize returns from less generous markets, all while aligning their financial choices with their ethical beliefs. Unfortunately, the trend shows that many are not choosing wisely.

The common disclaimer within the asset management field that past performance does not predict future results is especially relevant now. If market returns shift back to their long-term norms, a significant discrepancy could be seen in future growth of investments.

This situation indicates two potential dangers for those just setting out on their investment journey. One danger lies in the possibility of overestimating the market's ability to grow wealth, leading to insufficient savings for retirement. The second, perhaps more depressing possibility, is that a history of strong returns may have set unrealistic benchmarks, hinting that more modest returns might be on the horizon.

With regards to both stocks and bonds, what was once a period of climbing values — which boosted investor confidence and returns — could be facing a downturn. Both assets have seen long periods of gains that have ultimately drawn from future returns, limiting what new investors can expect.

Despite recent market adjustments which may seem to bode well for yields, the long-term outlook for stocks may suggest modest expectations. Although prices have recently recovered somewhat, this rally may not necessarily translate into sustainable long-term returns.

Therefore, it's important for young investors to make wise investment choices, particularly in these less promising market conditions. Fortunately, they have better tools and resources at their disposal than ever before. However, the landscape is also filled with potential missteps.

One common mistake is an excess holding of cash reserves. Many investors, particularly the younger generation, are inclined to a heavy cash allocation within their portfolios. This could be a defensive strategy in uncertain times or due to inertia, but it carries the risk of lost investment opportunity and erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.

Another mistake is a reluctance to invest in bonds, often seen as the counterpart to cash for its relative security. Though bonds have not always been appealing, particularly in recent times due to low yields, they now offer better potential returns and should be considered as part of a balanced investment strategy.

A contemporary snag is the allure of trendy investments, often represented through specialty exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These funds might target the latest market obsessions or appeal to specific moral or social convictions but can also come with increased risk and expenses that could potentially negate their appeal.

Recognizing the need for prudent financial steps is crucial, as the strategies and habits formed by young investors today could persist for years to come. It's helpful to remember to focus on what can be controlled and to distinguish between what they can and cannot change, a mindset reflective of timeless advice that could serve as the cornerstone of an effective investment philosophy.
