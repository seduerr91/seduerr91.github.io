## Machine Learning & Product Analytics Key Terms

- Type 1 and Type 2 error: 
- H0: Someone who has Covid tests positive.
- Type 1 error: Someone who does not have Covid tests positive (bad for the individual).
- Type 2 error: Someone who has Covid tests negative (bad for everyone).

## Theories

- Behavioral Change: operant (response is affected by consequences, e.g., gamification) vs classical conditioning (response occurs to stimuli, e.g., reminders)
- Personal Thoughts: Precontemplation > Contemplation > Preparation > Action > Maintenance (actively set goals for users and encourage them to hit the goals).
- Social Imitation: Consider collaboration features.
- Fogg Model of Change: pleasure / pain, hope / fair and social acceptance get lazy people to do things.
- ABA Model of Change: people engage in behavior to (a) achieve a desired result or (b) avoid an undesired result
- Randomized Variable Schedule: slot machines are addictive because the randomize administering awards
- Outsized positive rewards & mitigating losses: loss aversion
- Path dependence for least resistance: one step leads to the next step

## ML Terminology

- Supervised Learning: develop predictive models based on input and output (classification and regression).
- K-Nearest Neighbors: birds of a feather will flock together.
- Linear regression: identify lines that best fits data points.
- Logistic regression: used for binary outcome, probs of accepting a friend request.
- Decision trees: best of 20 questions.
- SVMs:  perceptron machine divides two dimensional space.
- Unsupervised Learning: group and interpret data based on input data.
- K-means: bucket observations in k clusters.
- PCA: converts correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated vectors.
- Dependent & independent variables: labels & key variable of interest.
- Confounding variables: variables that could drive spurious correlations.

## Different Test Statistics: 

- z-test / z-score: two populations, normal distribution
- t-test / t-statistic: two small samples, normal distribution
- anova / f-statistic: three or more samples, normal distribution
- chi-squared test / chi-squared: two samples, any distribution

## Regression terms: 

- Lasso (L1) Regularization: takes absolute value to avoid overfitting
- Ridge (L2) Regularization: takes squared value to avoid overfitting
- Normalization: adjusting different scales to same scale
- One-hot encoding: when we have data on more than one level (fe/male)
- Underfitting: too simple to explain variance
- Overfitting: forcefitting, too good to be true


## Validation of Supervised Learning: 

- Train, test validation: Test different models on test data / val data.
- K-fold cross validation: Create k-folds and use these as test data.
- F1-score:  2 * 1/recall + 1/precision.
- Area under ROC: visualization of classification error 
- (sensitivity = recall, specificity = 1-precision).
- Ad-Hoc Experiments - A/B Testing:
- Approach: experiment run on two groups of random users (RCT), one retrieving the treatment and one that does not.
- Premise: all conditions have to be the same for treated and control groups, except for the treatment.
- ATE (average treatment effect): what is the average difference in our chosen metric between treated and control groups.
- Example: Sending out friend requests with and without a personalized message

## Post-Hoc Experiments - Causal Inference Techniques: 

- Difference-in-Difference Modeling: find comparable counterfactual or control group to compare our treated users. (How do markets behave after airing or not airing a commercial in an area?)
- Placebo Testing: Test if there is no difference in two areas where there is no commercial aired.
- Regression Discontinuity: Find comparable counterfactuals or control group members to compare treated users against.
- Interrupted Time Series: 
- Autocorrelation: serial correlation between values of the process at different times.
- Stationarity: Mean and variance are constant over time.
- ARMA & ARIMA: autoregression models are linear regression models where we predict series values on the lagged value of the series itself
- Seasonality Decomposition: known patterns that are repeated over fixed time intervals.
- Statistical Matching: achieve similar distributions on observed variables for treatment and control.
- Propensity Matching: classification algorithm to assign a treatment score or a probability of being treated.
- General Heuristics: Educated guessing, dosage effect measuring, placebo tests, â€¦
- Uplift Modeling: targeting users that will modify their behavior based on treatment
- Random Forests: collection of many decision trees to identify features and make predictions
