### Where the heck is Cape Verde?

This is its [location](https://goo.gl/maps/zktFyETNYNQkDv787).

### Accommodation

- Mindelo in São Vicente. It's the first community of nomads here. It's all about the culture, a good coworking space, a good coworking café, yoga studio and 3 gyms. 
- We are staying in Casa Celestina, one of those, also Casa do Poço is incredible. 
- Airbnb is not bad here, but in our Discord channel we have several studios for 500 euros that are incredible. 
- It's very easy, everything, including contacts are on our [Discord channel](https://www.remoteworkingcaboverde.com/en)

### Activities
- 3 gyms, one good one: Energia.
- 2-3 yoga studios 
- We love to meet young expats and digital nomads. Is there quite a community, maybe even meet-ups? Every single day we meet for working and after working :) 
- Nature must be amazing to hike? Is it easy to jump islands (while staying on one) by boat? Nature is incredible, a lot of sports and best place in the world for kyte surf. 
- From São Vicente you are 1 hour by boat from the best island to hike, Santo Antão.

### Lifestyle 
- Do you think there are many options of international food (or rather local)? No international food, except Italian and Portuguese. 
- We are both gluten-free, do you think restaurants mind that? Except for the rice, you will be ok. The main dish here is cachupa, gluten free. Just say no Rice a lot of times. 
- Are there bars filled with locals and expats or will it rather be just tourists? Depends on the island. Sal is just a tourist location (so we don't go there). Mindelo is 95% locals. That's why we are here. :)
- I love Cabo Verde, perfect to escape winter, different culture, live music everywhere, safe and fun. BUT it depends on the island, each island could be a different country.
- I prefer culture, Mindelo is the capital of culture. If you prefer white sand beaches and calmness, then Boa Vista would be better for you. But from your questions, you need a small city so you have gyms, yoga and activities. Therefore, Mindelo is for you. And now, I go swim with turtles.
