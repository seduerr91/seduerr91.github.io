### Where the heck is Cape Verde?

This is its [location](https://goo.gl/maps/zktFyETNYNQkDv787).

#### Quote from Goncalo our local

_I love Cabo Verde, perfect to escape winter, different culture, live music everywhere, safe and fun. BUT it depends on the island, each island could be a different country._

### Find Accommodation in Mindelo

- The place to be is Mindelo on São Vicente. The first community of nomads houses here. It's all about the culture. Find...
  - a good coworking space, 
  - a good coworking café, 
  - a yoga studio and, 
  - 3 gyms - the best one being Energia. 
- Good locations are Casa Celestina, yet also Casa do Poço is incredible. 
- Airbnb options are affordable
- This [Discord channel](https://www.remoteworkingcaboverde.com/en) offers several all-included studios for 500 euros that are incredible.

### Activities
- There is quite a community that meets every single day for working and after working. :) 
- Nature is incredible, and offers a lot of sports. 
- It is the best place in the world for kyte surfing.
- São Vicente connets to Santo Antão, the best island for hikes (1 hour by boat).

### Food & Drinks
- Food options are dominantly local, except for Italian and Portuguese cuisine. 
- The main dish is cachupa which is gluten free. 
- Mindelo is 95% locals. That's why we are here. :)

Goncalo's resume: I prefer culture, and Mindelo is the capital of culture. If you prefer white sand beaches and calmness, then Boa Vista would be better for you. And now, I go swim with turtles...
