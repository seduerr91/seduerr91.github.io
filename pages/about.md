Hello, I'm Sebastian, a fervent Natural Language Processing (NLP) engineer and an accomplished manager. Beyond my technological acumen, I'm a global explorer, having spent two vibrant years as a digital nomad across 25 diverse nations. Four languages - English, Spanish, French, and German - are effortlessly part of my conversational repertoire, demonstrating my proficiency in thriving amidst diverse cultures. 

Despite my professional accomplishments, I believe in maintaining a balanced life. Thus, I devote time to yoga, swimming, hiking, cooking, reading, Pickleball and running. These activities keep me grounded and connect me to nature. 

My journey began at Germany's distinguished [University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/presse/pm/artikel/che-masterbefragung-2020/), where I studied Information Systems and bagged both a B.Sc and an M.Sc, graduating with honors. This experience ignited my interest in digital innovation that led to my fruitful two-year stint as a research assistant, collaborating with renowned professors to contribute to the latest research.

Working as the Chief Product Owner for consumer products at Raiffeisen Digital, Austria's leading bank, I had the opportunity to refine my leadership skills. Guiding various teams through complex projects, from [granting of loans](https://www.raiffeisen.at/ooe/de/privatkunden/kredit-leasing/konsumkredit.html), [opening of accounts](https://www.raiffeisen.at/ooe/de/privatkunden/konto/girokonto.html), to [qualifying for a credit card](https://www.raiffeisen.at/ooe/de/privatkunden/karte/kreditkarte.html) taught me to maneuver challenging professional scenarios. However, my thirst for knowledge was far from satisfied. 

In pursuit of further mastery in NLP, I took a sabbatical - a bold departure from the comfort of a well-settled managerial role. This led me back to academia, from being a visiting student at the esteemed [MIT's Center for Collective Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXANO-Mvo4) to my hands-on experience as an NLP Engineer at Narrativa. The journey was enriched by completing certification courses in [Machine Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/fcc43394ed8ce4a8b20daf705e4c3e976c6e028e), [Deep Learning in NLP](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/2N9ZQ8BVSG8H), and [Entrepreneurship at Y Combinator's Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/users/shWfuCCKk/certificate).

Now, with over five years of valuable NLP experience, I have become a respected figure in the industry. I take pride in my contributions, particularly in developing and training deep neural networks for NLP tasks.

Presently, I am an integral part of the team at Cordial. Here, I have the opportunity to seamlessly bridge the gap between management and engineering using my unique blend of business acumen and technical expertise. My philosophy of coupling practical knowledge with groundbreaking innovation aims to revolutionize natural language processing. My unique multilingual and multicultural approach empowers me to propel forward in the NLP field, setting new standards in the realm of global technological leadership.
