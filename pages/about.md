# **About Me**

Hi there, 

I am **Sebastian**, and my environment often describes me as a social butterfly. My **Management Expertise** comes from Product Development, and my **Software Engineering Skills** shine when it comes to Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Before my recent sabbatical at MIT, I assumed the role as *Chief Product Owner* for the banking product streams at Austria's biggest bank. Being the youngest manager in the company, I was responsible for the entire life cycle of a set of banking products with more than 80,000 clicks per month (e.g. granting of loans or opening of accounts). That meant the orchestration of fourteen projects for product development, optimization and operation. Besides, I gained expertise in disciplinary management of two business analysts, technical and budgetary management for three agile development teams as well as timely coordination with product specialist, marketing, sales and support units.

Trained in Information Systems from Germany's best [University](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/presse/pm/artikel/che-masterbefragung-2020/) in that field in 2020, I understand both languages of IT and business. In order to fluently navigate the tech side of product development, I took a year-long sabbatical at MIT to advance my coding knowledge. During that time, I certified in [Machine Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/fcc43394ed8ce4a8b20daf705e4c3e976c6e028e), [Deep Learning in NLP](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/2N9ZQ8BVSG8H), and went through [Y Combinator's Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/users/shWfuCCKk/certificate). 

In my free time, I love yoga, cooking, running, and coding.
