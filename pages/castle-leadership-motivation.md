## Joseph Nye - The Powers to Lead

- Good leadership matters. Good = effective and ethical. Good leaders share their luck.
- Leadership can be learned. It depends on nurture and on nature.
- Leaders help create and achieve group goals. Thus, effectiveness requires vision and interpersonal/organizational skills.
- Smart leaders need both soft and hard power skills: cooptive and command styles. Both transformational and transactional objectives & styles are useful. 
- Leaders depend on and are partly shaped by followers. Presence/magnetism is inherent in some personalities but "charisma" is mostly bestowed by followers. 
- Appropriate style depends on the context. There are 'autocratic' and 'democratic' situations, normal & crisis conditions, and routine and novel crises. Good diagnosis of the need for change (or not) is essential for contextual intelligence.
- Consultative style is more time costly but provides more information, creates buy-in and empowers followers.
- Managers maintain systems & institutions. They help a group decide how to decide.
- Leadership for crisis conditions requires advanced preparation, emotional maturity, and the ability to distinguish operational, analytical and political work.
- The information revolution is causing a secular shift int he context of postmodern organizations - from command to cooptive style. Empowered followers empower leaders.
- Reality testing, constant information seeking, and adjusting to change are essential for good consequences, but emotional intelligence and practical knowledge are more important than pure IQ and judgement.
- Three-dimensional ethical judgement requires attention to goals, means, and consequences for those inside and outside the leadership group. Creating identities in intergroup leadership is difficult but crucial.

## Barry Silverstein - Managing People

`If your staff is happy, you are doing your job. People don't often leave jobs - and, in particular, bosses - they like. Treat people the right way and you will have disciples for life.`

### Managing 101

- Delegation does not mean abdicating your responsibility; even if you delegate it is important to always monitor progress.
- Praise should be given in public, criticism must be offered in private.
- A step-by-step plan of action for accomplishing your goal is crucial.

### Managing Individuals

- Training (new employee orientations), on-the-job development, and formal training is key to employee's success and motivation.
- Feedback should be given often, not just during annual reviews.
- Disciplining an employee is a process: Oral and written reprimands, proceeds to probation, and termination as a last resort.

### Managing Teams

- Steps: define team's roles and goals, choose its members, foster cooperation, and insist on accountability.
- Match team members to their tasks, formalize their roles, and set the course.
- Motivational exercises, events, and material rewards can all help build enthusiasm.
- A manager provides clear direction, resolves conflicts, and empowers the team to perform on its own.

### Managing Projects

- Steps: define scope, allocate resources, organize your group, build a schedule, do a reality check, monitor your progress, analyze the outcome.
- Focussing on project scope helps you assess the resources, money and time needed.
- Define precise goals and objectives from the beginning of the project. 
- Anticipating, accessing and managing risks is essential.
- Managing multiple projects takes strategic planning.

### Leadership and Communication

- Leaders inspire trust, share their vision, formulate strategies, anticipate problems & opportunities, innovate, inspire & motivate.
- Managers execute plans, maintain order, and get things done.
- Active listening involves giving non-verbal cues to show that you are listening, rephrasing what has been said to show that you understand.

`Management is doing things right (efficiency), leadership is doing the right things (effectivity).`
