## Pickleball

### No. 1 Skill: Hit the kitchen from everywhere (drop shot, reset, dinks)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LExK3HvgODU]

- `Trajectory`: Have a nice arch. The further back the higher, the closer the lower the ball.
- `Footwork`: 
  - Back: Constantly move to the ball with many adjustment steps to keep the balance. 
  - Kitchen: One big step left or right. Don't get of balance or dance.
- `Technique`: 
  - Grip: Continental - index knuckle is on angled notch of the racket.
  - Use a compact motion (no floppy fish).
  - Stay on the same side (don't go cross body) - drawing a line towards target.
  - Power comes from shoulder.
  - Spin: Use the slice for a while.

### (10 Things I wish I knew earlier)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bnLUkNb7PA]

- Using the ATP: Use around the post shot when you get a very angular dink.
- Dink to the backhand: People are stronger on the forehand, therefore always dink to their backhand (most people are right hand) which might cause pop-ups. 
- Serving Strategy: Only go for hard serves if you're ahead, or do it with people that don't have a great return.
- Attack by redirecting the ball: If you go cross-court with dinks, then accelerate down the line.
- When to be patient: Exact players, the more patient one will win. Mostly play conservative. Make them go for the dumb shots. 
- Attack on the right balls: use every pop-up.
- Where to aim putaway shots: At their feet or open court (if they are in the middle), or straight down the middle if they are outside.
- The best time to poach: When one is long and you are short, poach.
- Mental hack to win more: expect speedups at the kitchen every time. Check his hand, keep your paddle up.

- `Having a strong ready position`:. Always keep the paddle up and ready and have a wide base on the legs. (Be low like a ferrari).
- `Drop`: Move forward on a good drop, if it's okay stay in transition zone, if it is bad - stay back.
- `Kitchen`: If you are about to get killed, make a step back.
- Always get quick to the kitchen of your returns.

### Fast Reactions

"DON'T GET PUNCHED IN THE FACE"

`Ready Position`: How we're waiting for the ball
- wide base (feet apart), bend knees
- racket up, slightly towards the left (to play backhand)
- laser focused

`Kitchen`
- When defending a hard shot, do very little backswing.
- Use the crab walk.
- Only move your arm, keep the rest still. Don't do a jump. 
- Always go immediately back to the ready position.
- Very little motion.
- Right shoulder is being covered by quickly moving back.
- Volleywar: right at opponents feet, always keep the ball low, their right shoulder, or middle/down the line (dependent on where they stand)

`Back`
- Have very tight grip to not pop up. 
- Take ball low at their feet.
