## Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman

#### Systems

- System 1: Fast, automatic thinking (lion-bird kills the kid) => stupid assumptions but allows us to run away.
- System 2: Slow but logical.

#### Biases and Fallacies

- Anchoring: is tallest redwood 180ft or 1200 ft? average guess is 282ft, respectively 844ft; we don't know what things shall cost (microwave mrsp)
- Availability bias: don't follow mainstream media (they sell horror), almost non-existing probability can be present (plane crash)
- Loss Aversion: playing coin tossing (win 1000/loss 1000) - people will be loss averse. Convince people by telling them what to lose (friends and family for alcoholics)
- Framing: 10% chance to die, 90% chance to live.
- Sunk cost fallacy: let past decisions affect current. If you losing 1000 in poker, you should go and leave. Throw away the candy. Throw away the stuff you do not need.
- Cognitive ease: Macchiavelli: topic of discussion is too complex to talk about. We ask simpler questions.
- Confirmation bias: Google: Is coconut oil good for you? <> Why coconut oil is good?
- The endowment effect: We value things highly if they are ours. Buyer vs. seller - is your religion/country really the best?
- Priming: If I talk about food you put so_p `u` into this, if I talk about cleaning you'll but an `a`.
- The halo effect: Rosy glasses, I like him and everything is correct. Two women commit same crime but one is beautiful. 
- The hindsight bias: be an expert after an event has occurred, stock is going to rise/fall.

## Flow: Psychology of Optimal Experience

- *"A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening `outside` just by changing the contents of consciousness"*.
- If you have a bigger house, you'd be happy but no! That is not how it works.
- Average income / percent of people who are very happy: income tripled but not more people are happy
- Happiness lies in flow: 
  - be so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. Intense concentration, no attention for problems or anything else.
  - Indians that move every 25 years to new place to encounter new challenges <> people sitting in front of TV / social media being apathetic.
- Theory:

| Skill \\ Challenge | Low     | High    |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| Low                | Apathy  | Anxiety |
| High               | Boredom | Ecstasy |

## The Prince
## The 80/20 Principle

## How to be happy

*"The primary cause of unhappiness is never due to the situation but what we think of it"*, Eckhardt Tolle.

## Rich Dad & Poor Dad
## On the Shortness of Life - Seneca

- "It is not that we have a short time to live 

## To Start with Why
## The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

- Be proactive: focus on things you can change, e.g. not inflation.
- Begin with the end in mind: You are at your funeral.
- Put first things first: difference between what we wanna do & what we do.
- Think win-win: two authors recommend each other.
- Seek first to understand, then to be understood: no one cares how much time you spent but offer value.
- Synergize: Picking apples from a tree works better together.
- Sharpen the saw: Cut the tree down faster with a saw.

## The Art of War

## Man's Search for Meaning

- The pursuit of happiness: Will Smith wants to become a stock broker, i.e. Hollywood's version of happiness.
- Happiness cannot be pursued, it is a birth certificate. Everybody has it. We just have to find it.
- Bus vs. Ferrari: It is only a different experience. However, if you are happy in the bus, you will not be happy in the Ferrari.
- If something "bad" happens we get pissed off, but we do not have to. It is always a chance to practice virtue.

## Stoicism

- If you are renting a house, and you are told that rent will increase in a year, reaction will be okay. If it happens unplanned than most people get very negative: expectations are wrong.
- *"If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it.; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment."*
- *"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength."* -> Renting example.
- *"When another one blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticism, go to their souls, penetrate insinde and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you."* => Bill Gates/Elon Musk won't call you a loser, but you are just negative if your life sucks. 
- *"How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy."* => My grandma was always super negative, but was all that she did alright?
