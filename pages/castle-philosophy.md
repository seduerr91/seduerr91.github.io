## `Istanbul` Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman

#### `` Systems

- System 1: Fast, automatic thinking (lion-bird kills the kid) => stupid assumptions but allows us to run away.
- System 2: Slow but logical.

#### `` Biases and Fallacies

- Anchoring: is tallest redwood 180ft or 1200 ft? average guess is 282ft, respectively 844ft; we don't know what things shall cost (microwave mrsp)
- Availability bias: don't follow mainstream media (they sell horror), almost non-existing probability can be present (plane crash)
- Loss Aversion: playing coin tossing (win 1000/loss 1000) - people will be loss averse. Convince people by telling them what to lose (friends and family for alcoholics)
- Framing: 10% chance to die, 90% chance to live.
- Sunk cost fallacy: let past decisions affect current. If you losing 1000 in poker, you should go and leave. Throw away the candy. Throw away the stuff you do not need.
- Cognitive ease: Macchiavelli: topic of discussion is too complex to talk about. We ask simpler questions.
- Confirmation bias: Google: Is coconut oil good for you? <> Why coconut oil is good?
- The endowment effect: We value things highly if they are ours. Buyer vs. seller - is your religion/country really the best?
- Priming: If I talk about food you put so_p `u` into this, if I talk about cleaning you'll but an `a`.
- The halo effect: Rosy glasses, I like him and everything is correct. Two women commit same crime but one is beautiful. 
- The hindsight bias: be an expert after an event has occurred, stock is going to rise/fall.

## `Sofia` Flow: Psychology of Optimal Experience

- *"A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening `outside` just by changing the contents of consciousness"*.
- If you have a bigger house, you'd be happy but no! That is not how it works.
- Average income / percent of people who are very happy: income tripled but not more people are happy
- Happiness lies in flow: 
  - be so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. Intense concentration, no attention for problems or anything else.
  - Indians that move every 25 years to new place to encounter new challenges <> people sitting in front of TV / social media being apathetic.
- Theory:

| Skill \\ Challenge | Low     | High    |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| Low                | Apathy  | Anxiety |
| High               | Boredom | Ecstasy |



## `Ohrid` How to Win Friends and Influence People

- Become genuinely interested in other people: If you meet a painter ask what they paint. Most people wait creepily to voice their perspective. Stop that.
- Show respect for the other man's opinion. Never tell a man he is wrong: Border discussion.
- Talk in terms of the other man's interest: Don't simply ask for subscription but ask if person wants to self-improve. Don't fish with cherries.
- Remember that a person's name is to them the sweetest and most important sound in any language: missing the name is awkward. Tricks: repeat name immediately, think how it is written out, think of other people with the same name.
- If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically: Mistake like driving too fast.
- Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely: Thank you for doing your job.

## `Athens` How to be happy

*"The primary cause of unhappiness is never due to the situation but what we think of it"*, Eckhardt Tolle.

```yaml
Stimulus -> Freedom to choose how to respond -> Response
```

## `Corfu` The Way of the Superior Man

- Stop hoping for the completion of anything in life: Doing a Ph.D. for 4 years and wait until you are finished. To realize, that you will just do another job after. Pick a job you enjoy. Like engineering.
- Don't get lost in tasks and duties: organize stuff, clean everything vs. pursuing your purpose. You don't wanna die and want them to say: They always cleaned everything.
- Be willing to change everything in your life: Boys are scared of change, develop yourself. Andrew Carnegie: "You can take away everything, we do not care!"
- Live as if your father was dead: does not deal with respect, as a boy people tell you what to do. Superior man respects & listens but knows what he wants.
- If you don't know your purpose, go find it: If you had all the money in the world. What would you do?
- Your purpose must come before your relationship: You must do sports to stay with her.
- Don't force the feminine to make decisions: It does not matter, if we were red or black shoes. Just help her.
- What she wants is not what she says: No = Yes.
- You are responsible for the growth and intimacy: after a time you are losing attraction, that is normal. Hence, research, keep her interesting, hold her and lead her.

- *"It is not that we have a short time to live but that we waste much of it. Life is long, and it's been given to us in generous measure for accomplishing the greatest things..."*
- At the end of their life, most people complain about too little time in their life.
- However people waste much of it:
  - being unconscious and drunk, watching TV.
  - people spend time on things they don't even like: Facebook.
  - people work as a slave from 9 to 5 until they are 65.
  - Then, they ask: Where did it all go?
- Summing that up, it's years. 
  - Giving up time is like giving money to everyone.
- Use your time: read, sport, quality time.

- *You can always make another dollar, but you will never have another hour. Use your time.*

## `Tirana` Start with Why

- I hate reading & teachers can't inspire me <=> mentors can.

  - If student asks "WHY"?, the teacher often would get angry.
- Mentors: success in relationships and business.
  - Do you want your mails to be open?
  - Do you want a happy relationship?
  - Then, pick up a book.

  - Everybody is obsessed with suing. 
  - Picking up the phone costs nothing, fighting does. Particularly time and energy.

## `Mostar` Man's Search for Meaning

- Bus vs. Ferrari: It is only a different experience. However, if you are happy in the bus, you will not be happy in the Ferrari.
- If something "bad" happens we get pissed off, but we do not have to. It is always a chance to practice virtue.

## `Split` Stoicism

- If you are renting a house, and you are told that rent will increase in a year, reaction will be okay. If it happens unplanned than most people get very negative: expectations are wrong.
- *"If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it.; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment."*
- *"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength."* -> Renting example.
- *"When another one blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticism, go to their souls, penetrate insinde and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you."* => Bill Gates/Elon Musk won't call you a loser, but you are just negative if your life sucks. 
- *"How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy."* => My grandma was always super negative, but was all that she did alright?

## `Zadar` The Power of Now

- Most people wake up with negative thoughts, although those won't happen or can be overcome (a C grade does not mean that you do not not have a future)
- If you are not aware of your thinking, then your brain can be quite dangerous
- Therefore, **be present**, i.e. watch *the thinker*
- Obstacles: 
  - past: What are your biggest regrets: Doesn't matter you cannot change it.
  - future: Cannot control, hence balance powerful vision, while being present.
    - rat racer (weak vision): 2 dollar raise after 2 years to be quasi happy.
    - no more goals (too present): I'm spiritual now.
- Vision & being present: rather be a mountain climber.
  - happiness is not in the peak (Helicopter could just drop you off; or wandering around the mountain).
  - happiness is constantly climbing towards your goals.

## `Florence` The Prince

- The book is information which is not inherently wrong or right, it is, however, powerful so it is good to be aware but not live all your relationships in a Macchiavellian style.
- "*How we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall rather than to his preservation.*"

  - Politics: you cannot be good and honest, you wouldn't get all votes.

## `Milan` Learned Optimism

- Dog 1 can escape shocks, dog 2 cannot (pavlov conditioning).

- You have the choice between a lemonade and a glass of water. Most people pick the soda, because you are not going to wake up unhealthy tomorrow. 
- People often believe: "It matters to do the important things right", so we eat kale one day.

  - (2) Skill acquisition: 10.000 hours.

## `Copenhagen` Predictably Irrational

- The truth about relativity: everything is relative even if it should not be.
  - Only a breadmaker for $99 didn't sell.
  - Adding another one for $199 made the first one sell, because people could relate to it. We don't know how much things should cost.
  - Restaurants usually offer $10, $35 and $70 wine, and most people pick the $35 one.
